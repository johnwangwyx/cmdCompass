       This manual page describes the GNU version of ttrrooffff.  It is part of the
       groff document formatting system.  It is functionally  compatible  with
       Unix  troff,  but  has  many extensions, see ggrrooffff__ddiiffff(7).  Usually it
       should be invoked using the ggrrooffff(1) command which will also  run  pre-
       processors  and  postprocessors  in  the appropriate order and with the
       appropriate options.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Whitespace is permitted between a command-line option and its argument.

       --aa     Generate an ASCII approximation of the typeset output.

       --bb     Print a backtrace with each  warning  or  error  message.   This
              backtrace  should  help  track down the cause of the error.  The
              line numbers given in the backtrace may not always  be  correct,
              for  ttrrooffff's  idea  of  line  numbers  gets confused by aass or aamm
              requests.

       --cc     Disable color output (always disabled in compatibility mode).

       --CC     Enable compatibility mode.

       --dd_c_s
       --dd_n_a_m_e==_s
              Define _c or _n_a_m_e to be a string _s; _c must be a one letter name.

       --EE     Inhibit all error messages of ttrrooffff.   Note  that  this  doesn't
              affect messages output to standard error by macro packages using
              the ttmm or ttmm11 requests.

       --ff_f_a_m  Use _f_a_m as the default font family.

       --FF_d_i_r  Search in directory (or directory path) _d_i_r  for  subdirectories
              _d_e_vname  (_n_a_m_e is the name of the device) and there for the _D_E_S_C
              file and font files.  _d_i_r  is  scanned  before  all  other  font
              directories.

       --ii     Read  the  standard  input  after all the named input files have
              been processed.

       --II_d_i_r  This option may be used to add a directory to  the  search  path
              for  files  (both  those  on the command line and those named in
              ..ppssbbbb requests).  The search path is initialized with  the  cur-
              rent  directory.   This  option may be specified more than once;
              the directories are then searched in the  order  specified  (but
              before  the current directory).  If you want to make the current
              directory be read before  other  directories,  add  --II..  at  the
              appropriate place.

              No directory search is performed for files with an absolute file
              name.

       --mm_n_a_m_e Read in the file name_._t_m_a_c.  If it isn't  found,  try  _t_m_a_c_.name
              instead.   It  will  be  first searched for in directories given
              with the --MM command-line option, then in  directories  given  in
              the  _G_R_O_F_F___T_M_A_C___P_A_T_H  environment  variable, then in the current
              directory (only if in unsafe mode), the home directory,  _d_:_/_u_s_r_/
              _l_i_b_/_g_r_o_f_f_/_s_i_t_e_-_t_m_a_c,  _d_:_/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_g_r_o_f_f_/_s_i_t_e_-_t_m_a_c,  and _d_:_/_u_s_r_/
              _s_h_a_r_e_/_g_r_o_f_f_/_1_._2_2_._4_/_t_m_a_c.

       --MM_d_i_r  Search directory (or directory path) _d_i_r for macro files.   This
              is scanned before all other macro directories.

       --nn_n_u_m  Number the first page _n_u_m.

       --oo_l_i_s_t Output  only  pages  in _l_i_s_t, which is a comma-separated list of
              page ranges; _n means print page _n, _m--_n means  print  every  page
              between  _m  and  _n,  --_n means print every page up to _n, _n-- means
              print every page from _n.  ttrrooffff will  exit  after  printing  the
              last page in the list.

       --rr_c_n
       --rr_n_a_m_e==_n
              Set  number  register  _c or _n_a_m_e to _n; _c must be a one character
              name; _n can be any troff numeric expression.

       --RR     Don't load _t_r_o_f_f_r_c and _t_r_o_f_f_r_c_-_e_n_d.

       --TT_n_a_m_e Prepare output for device _n_a_m_e, rather than the default ppss;  see
              ggrrooffff(1) for a more detailed description.

       --UU     Unsafe  mode.   This  will  enable the following requests: ooppeenn,
              ooppeennaa, ppssoo, ssyy, and ppii.  For security reasons, these potentially
              dangerous requests are disabled otherwise.  It will also add the
              current directory to the macro search path.

       --vv     Print the version number.

       --ww_n_a_m_e Enable warning _n_a_m_e.  Available warnings are described  in  sec-
              tion  "Warnings"  below.   To enable most useful warnings use --ww
              aallll.  To enable absolutely all warnings use --ww ww instead.   Mul-
              tiple --ww options are allowed.

       --WW_n_a_m_e Inhibit warning _n_a_m_e.  Multiple --WW options are allowed.

       --zz     Suppress formatted output.

WWAARRNNIINNGGSS
       The  warnings that can be given by ttrrooffff are divided into the following
       categories.  The name associated with each warning is used  by  the  --ww
       and  --WW  options;  the  number  is used by the wwaarrnn request, and by the
       ..wwaarrnn register; it is always a power of 2 to allow bitwise composition.

                           request.  These are conditions that are errors when
                           they do not occur in ignored text.

       iinnppuutt       16384   Invalid input characters.

       mmaacc           512   Use  of  undefined  strings, macros and diversions.
                           When an undefined string,  macro  or  diversion  is
                           used,  that  string  is  automatically  defined  as
                           empty.  So, in most cases, at most one warning will
                           be given for each name.

       mmiissssiinngg      8192   Requests that are missing non-optional arguments.

       nnuummbbeerr          2   Invalid  numeric  expressions.   This is enabled by
                           default.

       rraannggee          64   Out of range arguments.

       rreegg          1024   Use of undefined number registers.  When  an  unde-
                           fined  number  register  is  used, that register is
                           automatically defined to have a value of 0.  So, in
                           most  cases,  at most one warning will be given for
                           use of a particular name.

       ssppaaccee       65536   Missing space between a request or  macro  and  its
                           argument.  This warning will be given when an unde-
                           fined name longer than two  characters  is  encoun-
                           tered,  and  the  first  two characters of the name
                           make a defined name.  The request or macro will not
                           be  invoked.   When this warning is given, no macro
                           is  automatically  defined.   This  is  enabled  by
                           default.  This warning will never occur in compati-
                           bility mode.

       ssyynnttaaxx        128   Dubious syntax in numeric expressions.

       ttaabb          2048   Inappropriate use of a tab character.   Either  use
                           of  a tab character where a number was expected, or
                           use of tab character in an unquoted macro argument.

       There are also names that can be used to refer to groups of warnings:

       aallll    All warnings except ddii, mmaacc, and rreegg.  It is intended that  this
              covers all warnings that are useful with traditional macro pack-
              ages.

       Note  that _t_r_o_f_f_r_c and _t_r_o_f_f_r_c_-_e_n_d are searched for neither in the cur-
       rent nor the home directory by default for security  reasons  (even  if
       the  --UU  option  is  given).   Use  the  --MM  command-line option or the
       _G_R_O_F_F___T_M_A_C___P_A_T_H environment variable to add these  directories  to  the
       search path if necessary.
