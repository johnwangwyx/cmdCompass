       ggrrooppss translates the output of GNU ttrrooffff to PostScript.  Normally ggrrooppss
       should  be  invoked  by  using  the  groff  command with a --TTppss option.
       (Actually, this is the default for groff.)   If  no  files  are  given,
       ggrrooppss  reads  the standard input.  A filename of -- also causes ggrrooppss to
       read the standard input.  PostScript output is written to the  standard
       output.   When  ggrrooppss  is  run  by ggrrooffff options can be passed to ggrrooppss
       using ggrrooffff's --PP option.

       Note that ggrrooppss doesn't produce a valid document structure  (conforming
       to  the  Document  Structuring Convention) if called with multiple file
       arguments.  To print such concatenated output it is necessary to  deac-
       tivate  DSC handling in the printing program or previewer.  See section
       "Font Installation" below for a guide how to install fonts for ggrrooppss.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Whitespace is permitted between a command-line option and its argument.

       --bb_n    Provide workarounds for older  printers,  broken  spoolers,  and
              previewers.   Normally  ggrrooppss produces output at PostScript Lan-
              guageLevel 2 that conforms to the Document  Structuring  Conven-
              tions  version 3.0.  Some older printers, spoolers, and preview-
              ers can't handle such output.  The  value  of  _n  controls  what
              ggrrooppss  does  to  make its output acceptable to such programs.  A
              value of 0 causes grops not to employ any workarounds.

              Add 1 if no %%%%BBeeggiinnDDooccuummeennttSSeettuupp and %%%%EEnnddDDooccuummeennttSSeettuupp comments
              should  be generated; this is needed for early versions of Tran-
              Script that get confused by  anything  between  the  %%%%EEnnddPPrroolloogg
              comment and the first %%%%PPaaggee comment.

              Add  2  if  lines  in included files beginning with %%!! should be
              stripped out; this is needed for Sun's pageview previewer.

              Add 4 if %%%%PPaaggee, %%%%TTrraaiilleerr and %%%%EEnnddPPrroolloogg  comments  should  be
              stripped out of included files; this is needed for spoolers that
              don't understand the %%%%BBeeggiinnDDooccuummeenntt and %%%%EEnnddDDooccuummeenntt comments.

              Add 8 if the first line of the PostScript output should be %%!!PPSS--
              AAddoobbee--22..00  rather than %%!!PPSS--AAddoobbee--33..00; this is needed when using
              Sun's Newsprint with a printer that requires page reversal.

              Add 16 if no media size information should be  included  in  the
              document  (this  is,  neither  use  %%%%DDooccuummeennttMMeeddiiaa nor the sseett--
              ppaaggeeddeevviiccee PostScript command).  This was the behaviour of groff
              version  1.18.1  and  earlier;  it  is needed for older printers
              which don't understand PostScript LanguageLevel 2.  It  is  also
              necessary  if the output is further processed to get an encapsu-
              lated PS (EPS) file - see below.

              The default value can be specified by a

                     bbrrookkeenn _n

              command in the _D_E_S_C file.  Otherwise the default value is 0.

       --cc_n    Print _n copies of each page.

       --FF_d_i_r  Prepend directory dir_/_d_e_vname to the search path  for  prologue,
              font,  and  device  description  files;  _n_a_m_e is the name of the
              device, usually ppss.

       --gg     Guess the page length.   This  generates  PostScript  code  that
              guesses  the  page  length.   The  guess  is correct only if the
              imageable area is vertically centered on the page.  This  option
              allows  you  to  generate  documents that can be printed both on
              letter (8.5x11) paper and on A4 paper without change.

       --II_d_i_r  This option may be used to add a directory to  the  search  path
              for  files on the command line and files named in \\XX''ppss:: iimmppoorrtt''
              and \\XX''ppss:: ffiillee'' escapes.  The search path is  initialized  with
              the  current  directory.  This option may be specified more than
              once; the directories are then searched in the  order  specified
              (but  before  the  current  directory).  If you want to make the
              current directory be read before other directories, add  --II..  at
              the appropriate place.

              No directory search is performed for files with an absolute file
              name.

       --ll     Print the document in landscape format.

       --mm     Turn manual feed on for the document.

       --pp_p_a_p_e_r_-_s_i_z_e
              Set physical dimension of output  medium.   This  overrides  the
              ppaappeerrssiizzee,  ppaappeerrlleennggtthh,  and  ppaappeerrwwiiddtthh  commands  in the _D_E_S_C
              file; it accepts the same arguments as  the  ppaappeerrssiizzee  command.
              See ggrrooffff__ffoonntt ((55)) for details.

       --PP_p_r_o_l_o_g_u_e_-_f_i_l_e
              Use  the  file  _p_r_o_l_o_g_u_e_-_f_i_l_e (in the font path) as the prologue
              instead of the default  prologue  file  pprroolloogguuee.   This  option
              overrides the environment variable _G_R_O_P_S___P_R_O_L_O_G_U_E_.

       --ww_n    Lines  should  be drawn using a thickness of _n thousandths of an
              em.  If this option is not given, the line thickness defaults to
              0.04 em.

       --vv     Print the version number.

UUSSAAGGEE
       The  input  to ggrrooppss must be in the format output by ttrrooffff(1).  This is
       described in ggrrooffff__oouutt(5).

       In addition, the device and font description files for the device  used
       must  meet certain requirements: The resolution must be an integer mul-
       tiple of 72 times the ssiizzeessccaallee.  The ppss device uses  a  resolution  of
       72000 and a sizescale of 1000.

       The  device  description  file  must  contain  a  valid paper size; see
       ggrrooffff__ffoonntt(5) for more information.

       Each font description file must contain a command

              iinntteerrnnaallnnaammee _p_s_n_a_m_e

       which says that the PostScript name of the font is _p_s_n_a_m_e.  It may also
       contain a command

              eennccooddiinngg _e_n_c___f_i_l_e

       which  says  that  the  PostScript  font  should be reencoded using the
       encoding described in _e_n_c___f_i_l_e; this file should consist of a  sequence
       of lines of the form:

              _p_s_c_h_a_r _c_o_d_e

       where  _p_s_c_h_a_r  is the PostScript name of the character, and _c_o_d_e is its
       position in the encoding expressed as a decimal integer;  valid  values
       are  in  the range 0 to 255.  Lines starting with ## and blank lines are
       ignored.  The code for each character given in the font file must  cor-
       respond  to the code for the character in encoding file, or to the code
       in the default encoding for the font if the PostScript font is  not  to
       be  reencoded.   This  code  can be used with the \\NN escape sequence in
       ttrrooffff to select the character, even if the character does  not  have  a
       groff  name.   Every character in the font file must exist in the Post-
       Script font, and the widths given in  the  font  file  must  match  the
       widths  used  in  the  PostScript font.  ggrrooppss assumes that a character
       with a groff name of ssppaaccee is blank (makes no marks on  the  page);  it
       can make use of such a character to generate more efficient and compact
       PostScript output.

       Note that ggrrooppss is able to display all glyphs in a PostScript font, not
       only 256.  _e_n_c___f_i_l_e (or the default encoding if no encoding file speci-
       fied) just defines the order of glyphs for the  first  256  characters;
       all  other  glyphs  are accessed with additional encoding vectors which
       ggrrooppss produces on the fly.

       ggrrooppss can automatically include the  downloadable  fonts  necessary  to
       print  the document.  Such fonts must be in PFA format.  Use ppffbbttooppss(1)
       to convert a Type 1 font in PFB format.  Any downloadable  fonts  which
       should,  when required, be included by ggrrooppss must be listed in the file
       _d_:_/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_g_r_o_f_f_/_1_._2_2_._4_/_f_o_n_t_/_d_e_v_p_s_/_d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d; this should  consist  of
       lines of the form

              _f_o_n_t _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

       where _f_o_n_t is the PostScript name of the font, and _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is the name
       of the file containing the font; lines beginning with ## and blank lines
       are  ignored;  fields  may  be separated by tabs or spaces; _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is
       searched for using the same mechanism that is used for groff font  met-
       ric  files.   The  _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d file itself is also searched for using this
       mechanism; currently, only the first found file in  the  font  path  is
       used.

       If  the  file  containing a downloadable font or imported document con-
       forms to the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions, then ggrrooppss  inter-
       prets  any  comments  in  the files sufficiently to ensure that its own
       output is conforming.  It also supplies any needed font resources  that
       are  listed  in the _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d file as well as any needed file resources.
       It is also able to handle inter-resource  dependencies.   For  example,
       suppose  that  you have a downloadable font called Garamond, and also a
       downloadable font called Garamond-Outline  which  depends  on  Garamond
       (typically  it would be defined to copy Garamond's font dictionary, and
       change the PaintType), then it is  necessary  for  Garamond  to  appear
       before Garamond-Outline in the PostScript document.  ggrrooppss handles this
       automatically provided that the downloadable font  file  for  Garamond-
       Outline  indicates  its dependence on Garamond by means of the Document
       Structuring Conventions, for example by beginning  with  the  following
       lines

              %%!!PPSS--AAddoobbee--33..00 RReessoouurrccee--FFoonntt
              %%%%DDooccuummeennttNNeeeeddeeddRReessoouurrcceess:: ffoonntt GGaarraammoonndd
              %%%%EEnnddCCoommmmeennttss
              %%%%IInncclluuddeeRReessoouurrccee:: ffoonntt GGaarraammoonndd

       In this case both Garamond and Garamond-Outline would need to be listed
       in the _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d file.  A downloadable font should not include  its  own
       name in a %%%%DDooccuummeennttSSuupppplliieeddRReessoouurrcceess comment.

       ggrrooppss  does  not  interpret  %%%%DDooccuummeennttFFoonnttss comments.  The %%%%DDooccuummeenntt--
       NNeeeeddeeddRReessoouurrcceess,    %%%%DDooccuummeennttSSuupppplliieeddRReessoouurrcceess,     %%%%IInncclluuddeeRReessoouurrccee,
       %%%%BBeeggiinnRReessoouurrccee,  and  %%%%EEnnddRReessoouurrccee  comments  (or  possibly  the  old
       %%%%DDooccuummeennttNNeeeeddeeddFFoonnttss, %%%%DDooccuummeennttSSuupppplliieeddFFoonnttss, %%%%IInncclluuddeeFFoonntt, %%%%BBeeggiinn--
       FFoonntt, and %%%%EEnnddFFoonntt comments) should be used.

       In the default setup there are styles called RR, II, BB, and BBII mounted at
       font positions 1 to 4.  The fonts are grouped into families AA,  BBMM,  CC,
       HH, HHNN, NN, PP, and TT having members in each of these styles:

              TTBB     Times-Bold
              TTBBII    Times-BoldItalic

       There is also the following font which is not a member of a family:

              ZZCCMMII   ZapfChancery-MediumItalic

       There  are also some special fonts called SS for the PS Symbol font, and
       SSSS, containing slanted lowercase Greek letters taken  from  PS  Symbol.
       Zapf  Dingbats  is available as ZZDD, and a reversed version of ZapfDing-
       bats (with symbols pointing in the opposite direction) is available  as
       ZZDDRR;  most  characters  in these fonts are unnamed and must be accessed
       using \\NN.

       The default color for \\mm and \\MM is black; for  colors  defined  in  the
       `rgb'  color  space  sseettrrggbbccoolloorr is used, for `cmy' and `cmyk' sseettccmmyykk--
       ccoolloorr, and for `gray' sseettggrraayy.  Note that sseettccmmyykkccoolloorr is a  PostScript
       LanguageLevel 2 command and thus not available on some older printers.

       ggrrooppss  understands  various  X  commands  produced  using the \\XX escape
       sequence; ggrrooppss only interprets commands that begin with a ppss:: tag.

       \\XX''ppss:: eexxeecc _c_o_d_e''
              This executes the arbitrary PostScript commands  in  _c_o_d_e.   The
              PostScript currentpoint is set to the position of the \\XX command
              before executing _c_o_d_e.  The origin is at the top left corner  of
              the  page,  and  y coordinates increase down the page.  A proce-
              dure uu is defined that converts groff units  to  the  coordinate
              system  in  effect (provided the user doesn't change the scale).
              For example,

                     ..nnrr xx 11ii
                     \\XX''ppss:: eexxeecc \\nnxx uu 00 rrlliinneettoo ssttrrookkee''

              draws a horizontal line one inch long.  _c_o_d_e may make changes to
              the  graphics  state, but any changes persist only to the end of
              the page.  A dictionary containing the definitions specified  by
              the  ddeeff  and  mmddeeff  is on top of the dictionary stack.  If your
              code adds definitions to this dictionary,  you  should  allocate
              space  for  them  using  \\XX''ppss mmddeeff _n''.  Any definitions persist
              only until the end of the  page.   If  you  use  the  \\YY  escape
              sequence  with  an  argument that names a macro, _c_o_d_e can extend
              over multiple lines.  For example,

                     ..nnrr xx 11ii
                     ..ddee yy
                     ppss:: eexxeecc
                     \\nnxx uu 00 rrlliinneettoo
                     ssttrrookkee
                     ....
                     \\YYyy

              is another way to draw a horizontal line one  inch  long.   Note
              the single backslash before `nx' - the only reason to use a num-
              ber register while defining the macro `y' is to convert a  user-
              specified  dimension  `1i'  to internal groff units which are in
              turn converted to PS units with the uu procedure.

              ggrrooppss wraps user-specified PostScript code  into  a  dictionary,
              nothing  more.   In  particular,  it  doesn't  start and end the
              inserted code with ssaavvee and rreessttoorree, respectively.  This must be
              supplied by the user, if necessary.

       \\XX''ppss:: ffiillee _n_a_m_e''
              This  is the same as the eexxeecc command except that the PostScript
              code is read from file _n_a_m_e.

       \\XX''ppss:: ddeeff _c_o_d_e''
              Place a PostScript definition contained in _c_o_d_e in the prologue.
              There  should  be  at  most one definition per \\XX command.  Long
              definitions can be split over several \\XX commands; all the  _c_o_d_e
              arguments are simply joined together separated by newlines.  The
              definitions are placed in a dictionary  which  is  automatically
              pushed on the dictionary stack when an eexxeecc command is executed.
              If you use the \\YY escape sequence with an argument that names  a
              macro, _c_o_d_e can extend over multiple lines.

       \\XX''ppss:: mmddeeff _n _c_o_d_e''
              Like  ddeeff,  except  that  _c_o_d_e  may contain up to _n definitions.
              ggrrooppss needs to know how many definitions _c_o_d_e contains  so  that
              it  can  create  an appropriately sized PostScript dictionary to
              contain them.

       \\XX''ppss:: iimmppoorrtt _f_i_l_e _l_l_x _l_l_y _u_r_x _u_r_y _w_i_d_t_h [ _h_e_i_g_h_t ]''
              Import a PostScript graphic from _f_i_l_e.  The arguments _l_l_x,  _l_l_y,
              _u_r_x, and _u_r_y give the bounding box of the graphic in the default
              PostScript coordinate system; they should all be  integers;  _l_l_x
              and  _l_l_y are the x and y coordinates of the lower left corner of
              the graphic; _u_r_x and _u_r_y are the x  and  y  coordinates  of  the
              upper right corner of the graphic; _w_i_d_t_h and _h_e_i_g_h_t are integers
              that give the desired width and height in  groff  units  of  the
              graphic.

              The  graphic  is scaled so that it has this width and height and
              translated so that the lower  left  corner  of  the  graphic  is
              located  at  the  position  associated  with \\XX command.  If the
              height argument is omitted it is scaled uniformly in the  x  and
              y directions so that it has the specified width.

              Note  that the contents of the \\XX command are not interpreted by
              ttrrooffff; so vertical space for the graphic  is  not  automatically
              added,  and  the  _w_i_d_t_h  and _h_e_i_g_h_t arguments are not allowed to
              have attached scaling indicators.

              If the PostScript file complies with the Adobe  Document  Struc-
              turing  Conventions  and  contains a %%%%BBoouunnddiinnggBBooxx comment, then
              the bounding box can  be  automatically  extracted  from  within
              groff by using the ppssbbbb request.

              See  ggrrooffff__ttmmaacc(5)  for  a  description of the PPSSPPIICC macro which
              provides a convenient  high-level  interface  for  inclusion  of
              PostScript graphics.

              No  output  is  generated for text and drawing commands that are
              bracketed with these \\XX commands.  These commands  are  intended
              for  use  when  output from ttrrooffff is previewed before being pro-
              cessed with ggrrooppss; if the previewer is unable to display certain
              characters or other constructs, then other substitute characters
              or constructs can be used for previewing by bracketing them with
              these \\XX commands.

              For  example,  ggxxddiittvviieeww  is  not  able to display a proper \\((eemm
              character because the standard X11 fonts do not provide it; this
              problem can be overcome by executing the following request

                     ..cchhaarr \\((eemm \\XX''ppss:: iinnvviiss''\\

              In  this case, ggxxddiittvviieeww is unable to display the \\((eemm character
              and draws the line, whereas ggrrooppss prints the \\((eemm character  and
              ignores the line (this code is already in file XXppss..ttmmaacc which is
              loaded if a  document  intended  for  ggrrooppss  is  previewed  with
              ggxxddiittvviieeww).

       If  a  PostScript  procedure BBPPhhooookk has been defined via a `ppss:: ddeeff' or
       `ppss:: mmddeeff' device command, it is executed at  the  beginning  of  every
       page  (before  anything is drawn or written by groff).  For example, to
       underlay the page contents with the word `DRAFT'  in  light  gray,  you
       might use

       TrueType fonts can be used with ggrrooppss if converted  first  to  TTyyppee  4422
       format,  a special PostScript wrapper equivalent to the PFA format men-
       tioned in ppffbbttooppss(1).  There are several different methods to  generate
       a  type42  wrapper  and  most  of  them involve the use of a PostScript
       interpreter such as Ghostscript - see ggss(1).

       Yet,  the  easiest  method  involves  the  use   of   the   application
       ttttffttoott4422(1).  This program uses ffrreeeettyyppee(3) (version 1.3.1) to generate
       type42 font wrappers and well-formed AFM files that can be fed  to  the
       aaffmmttooddiitt(1)  script  to create appropriate metric files.  The resulting
       font wrappers should be added to the _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d  file.   ttttffttoott4422  source
       code  can  be  downloaded  from  ftp://www.giga.or.at/pub/nih/ttftot42/
       <ftp://www.giga.or.at/pub/nih/ttftot42/>.

       Another solution for creating type42  wrappers  is  to  use  FontForge,
       available from http://fontforge.sf.net <http://fontforge.sf.net>.  This
       font editor can convert most outline font formats.

FFOONNTT IINNSSTTAALLLLAATTIIOONN
       This section gives a summary of the above explanations; it can serve as
       a step-by-step font installation guide for ggrrooppss.

        +o  Convert your font to something groff understands.  This is either a
           PostScript Type 1 font in PFA format or a PostScript Type 42  font,
           together with an AFM file.

           The very first characters in a PFA file look like this:

                  %%!!PPSS--AAddoobbeeFFoonntt--11..00::

           A  PFB file has this also in the first line, but the string is pre-
           ceded with some binary bytes.

           The very first characters in a Type 42 font file look like this:

                  %%!!PPSS--TTrruueeTTyyppeeFFoonntt

           This is a wrapper format for TrueType fonts.  Old PS printers might
           not  support  it (this is, they don't have a built-in TrueType font
           interpreter).

           If your font is in PFB format (such fonts normally have _._p_f_b as the
           file  extension),  you might use groff's ppffbbttooppss(1) program to con-
           vert it to PFA.  For TrueType fonts,  try  ttttffttoott4422  or  ffoonnttffoorrggee.
           For  all  other  font  formats use ffoonnttffoorrggee which can convert most
           outline font formats.

        +o  Convert the AFM file to a groff  font  description  file  with  the
           aaffmmttooddiitt(1) program.  An example call is

                  afmtodit Foo-Bar-Bold.afm textmap FBB

           which  converts  the metric file _F_o_o_-_B_a_r_-_B_o_l_d_._a_f_m to the groff font
           _F_B_B.  If you have a font family  which  comes  with  normal,  bold,
           italic, and bold italic faces, it is recommended to use the letters
           RR, BB, II, and BBII, respectively, as postfixes in the groff font names
           to  make groff's `.fam' request work.  An example is groff's built-
           in Times-Roman font: The font family name is TT, and the groff  font
           names are TTRR, TTBB, TTII, and TTBBII.

        +o  Install  both  the  groff font description files and the fonts in a
           _d_e_v_p_s subdirectory of the font path which groff finds.  See section
           "Environment"  in  ttrrooffff(1)  for the actual value of the font path.
           Note that groff doesn't use the AFM files (but it is a good idea to
           store them anyway).

        +o  Register  all  fonts which must be downloaded to the printer in the
           _d_e_v_p_s_/_d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d file.  Only the first occurrence of this file in the
           font  path  is  read.   This means that you should copy the default
           _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d file to the first directory in your font path and add your
           fonts  there.   To continue the above example we assume that the PS
           font name for _F_o_o_-_B_a_r_-_B_o_l_d_._p_f_a is `XY-Foo-Bar-Bold'  (the  PS  font
           name is stored in the iinntteerrnnaallnnaammee field in the _F_B_B file), thus the
           following line should be added to _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d.

       groff versions 1.19.2 and earlier contain a slightly different  set  of
       the  35  Adobe  core  fonts;  the  difference is mainly the lack of the

       To  use  them,  make sure that ggrrooppss finds the fonts before the default
       system fonts (with the same names): Either add command-line  option  --FF
       to ggrrooppss

              If this is set to _f_o_o, then ggrrooppss uses the file _f_o_o (in the font
              path) instead of the default prologue file pprroolloogguuee.  The option
