       soelim - interpret .so requests in groff input

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       ssooeelliimm [--CCrrttvv] [--II _d_i_r] [_f_i_l_e ...]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ssooeelliimm reads _f_i_l_e_s and replaces lines of the form

              ..ssoo _f_i_l_e

       by  the contents of _f_i_l_e.  It is useful if files included with ..ssoo need
       to be preprocessed.  Normally, ssooeelliimm should be  invoked  with  the  --ss
       option of ggrrooffff.

       To  embed  `\' in the file name, write `\\' or `\e'.  To embed a space,
       write `\ '.  Any other escape sequence in _f_i_l_e makes ssooeelliimm ignore  the
       whole line.

       Note  that  there must be no whitespace between the leading dot and the
       two characters `s' and `o'.  Otherwise, only ggrrooffff interprets  the  ..ssoo
       request (and ssooeelliimm ignores it).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Whitespace is permitted between a command-line option and its argument.

       --CC     Recognize ..ssoo even when followed by a character other than space
              or newline.

       --II_d_i_r  This option may be used to add a directory to  the  search  path
              for files (both those on the command line and those named in ..ssoo
              requests).  The search path  is  initialized  with  the  current
              directory.   This  option  may  be specified more than once; the
              directories are then searched in the order specified (but before
              the  current directory).  If you want to make the current direc-
              tory be read before other directories, add --II.. at the  appropri-
              ate place.

              No directory search is performed for files with an absolute file
              name.

       --rr     Do not add ..llff requests (for general use, with non-groff files).

       --tt     Don't emit ..llff requests but TeX  comment  lines  (starting  with
              `%') giving the current file and line number.

       --vv     Print the version number.

       The normal processing sequence of groff is this:

                 input        sourced
                 file          file
                   |             |
                   v             v
               preprocessor -> troff -> postprocessor
                                             |
                                             v
                                          output
                                           file

       That  is,  files  sourced with ..ssoo are normally read _o_n_l_y by ttrrooffff (the
       actual formatter).  ssooeelliimm is _n_o_t required for ttrrooffff to source files.

       If a file to be sourced should also be preprocessed, it must already be
       read  _b_e_f_o_r_e  the  input file passes through the preprocessor.  This is
       handled by ssooeelliimm:

                 input
                 file
                   |
                   v
                 soelim -> preprocessor -> troff -> postprocessor
                   ^                                     |
                   |                                     v
                sourced                               output
                 file                                  file
