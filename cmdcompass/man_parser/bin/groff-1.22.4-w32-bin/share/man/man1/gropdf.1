.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ====================================================================
.
.B gropdf
translates the output of GNU
.B troff
to PDF.
.
Normally
.B gropdf
should be invoked by using the groff command
with a
.B \-Tpdf
option.
.
If no files are given,
.B gropdf
reads the standard input.
.
A filename of
.B \-
also causes
.B gropdf
to read the standard input.
.
PDF output is written to the standard output.
.
When
.B gropdf
is run by
.B groff
options can be passed to
.B gropdf
using
.BR groff 's
.B \-P
option.
.
.
.LP
See section \[lq]Font Installation\[rq] below for a guide how to install
fonts for
.BR gropdf .
.
.
.\" ====================================================================
.SH OPTIONS
.\" ====================================================================
.
Whitespace is permitted between a command-line option and its argument.
.
.
.TP
.B \-d
Include debug information as comments within the PDF.
.
Also produces an uncompressed PDF.
.
.
.TP
.B \-e
Forces
.B gropdf
to embed
.I all
fonts (even the 14 base PDF fonts).
.
.
.TP
.BI \-F " dir"
Prepend directory
.IR dir /dev name
to the search path for font, and device description files;
.I name
is the name of the device, usually
.BR pdf .
.
.TP
.BI \-I " dir"
This option may be used to add a directory to the search path for
files named in
.B \[rs]X'pdf: pdfpic'
escape.
.
The current directory is always searched first.
.
This option may be specified more than once; the directories are then
searched in the order specified.
.
.IP
No directory search is performed for files with an absolute file name.
.
.TP
.B \-l
Orient the document in landscape format.
.
.TP
.BI \-p " paper-size"
Set physical dimension of output medium.
.
This overrides the
.BR papersize ,
.BR paperlength ,
and
.B paperwidth
commands in the
.I DESC
file; it accepts the same arguments as the
.B papersize
command.
.
See
.BR groff_font (5)
for details.
.
.
.TP
.B \-s
Append a comment line to end of PDF showing statistics,
i.e.\& number of pages in document.
.
Ghostscript's
.B ps2pdf
complains about this line if it is included, but works anyway.
.
.
.TP
.B \-u\c
.RI " [" cmapfile ]
.B Gropdf
normally includes a ToUnicode CMap with any font created using
.I text.enc
as the encoding file,
this makes it easier to search for words which contain ligatures.
.
You can include your own CMap by specifying a
.I cmapfile
or have no CMap at all by omitting the argument.
.
.
.TP
.B \-v
.TQ
.B \-\-version
Print the version number and exit.

Set the foundry to use for selecting fonts of the same name.
.
.
.\" ====================================================================
.SH USAGE
.\" ====================================================================
.
The input to
.B gropdf
must be in the format output by
.BR troff (1).
.
This is described in
.BR groff_out (5).
.
.
.LP
In addition, the device and font description files for the device used
must meet certain requirements:
.
The resolution must be an integer multiple of\~72 times the
.BR sizescale .
.
The
.B pdf
device uses a resolution of 72000 and a sizescale of 1000.
.
.
.LP
The device description file must contain a valid paper size; see
.BR groff_font (5)
for more information.
.
.B gropdf
uses the same Type\~1 Adobe PostScript fonts as the
.B grops
device driver.
.
Although the PDF Standard allows the use of other font types (like
TrueType) this implementation only accepts the Type\~1 PostScript
font.
.
Fewer Type\~1 fonts are supported natively in PDF documents than the
standard 35 fonts supported by
.B grops
and all PostScript printers, but all the fonts are available since any
which aren't supported natively are automatically embedded in the
PDF.
.
.
.LP
.B gropdf
supports the concept of foundries, that is different versions of basically
the same font.
.
During install a
.I Foundry
file controls where fonts are found and builds
.B groff
fonts from the files it discovers on your system.
.
.
.LP
Each font description file must contain a command
.
.IP
.BI internalname\  psname
.
.LP
which says that the PostScript name of the font is
.IR psname .
.
Lines starting with
.B #
and blank lines are ignored.
.
The code for each character given in the font file must correspond
to the code in the default encoding for the font.
.
This code can be used with the
.B \[rs]N
escape sequence in
.B troff
to select the character,
even if the character does not have a groff name.
.
Every character in the font file must exist in the PostScript font, and
the widths given in the font file must match the widths used
in the PostScript font.
.
.
.LP
Note that
.B gropdf
is currently only able to display the first 256 glyphs in any font.
This restriction will be lifted in a later version.
.
.
.\" .LP
.\" Note that
.\" .B grops
.\" is able to display all glyphs in a PostScript font, not only 256.
.\" .I enc_file
.\" (or the default encoding if no encoding file specified) just defines the
.\" order of glyphs for the first 256 characters; all other glyphs are
.\" accessed with additional encoding vectors which
.\" .B grops
.\" produces on the fly.
.
.
.LP
.B gropdf
can automatically include the downloadable fonts necessary
to print the document.
.
Fonts may be in PFA or PFB format.
.LP
.
Any downloadable fonts which should, when required, be included by
.B gropdf
must be listed in the file
.IR d:/\:usr/\:share/\:groff/\:1.22.4/\:font/devpdf/download ;
this should consist of lines of the form
.
.IP
.I
foundry font filename
.
.LP
where
.I foundry
is the foundry name or blank for the default foundry.
.
.I font
is the PostScript name of the font,
and
.I filename
is the name of the file containing the font;
lines beginning with
.B #
and blank lines are ignored;
fields must be separated by tabs
(spaces are
.B not
allowed);
.I filename
is searched for using the same mechanism that is used
for groff font metric files.
.
The
.I download
file itself is also searched for using this mechanism;
currently, only the first found file in the font path is used.
.
Foundry names are usually a single character (such as \[oq]U\[cq] for
the URW Foundry) or blank for the default foundry.
.
This default uses the same fonts as
.B ghostscript
uses when it embeds fonts in a PDF file.
.
.
.LP
In the default setup there are styles called
.BR R ,
.BR I ,
.BR B ,
and
.B BI
mounted at font positions 1 to\~4.
.
The fonts are grouped into families
.BR A ,
.BR BM ,
.BR C ,
.BR H ,
.BR HN ,
.BR N ,
.BR P ,
and\~\c
.B T
having members in each of these styles:

There are also some special fonts called

for the PS Symbol font.
.
The lower case greek characters are automatically slanted (to match
the SymbolSlanted font (SS) available to PostScript).
.
Zapf Dingbats is available as
.BR ZD ,
the "hand pointing left" glyph (\[rs][lh]) is available since it has
been defined using the \[rs]X'pdf: xrev' extension which reverses the
direction of letters within words.
.

.LP
The default color for
.B \[rs]m

.LP
.B gropdf
understands some of the X\~commands produced using the
.B \[rs]X
escape sequences supported by
.B grops.
Specifically, the following is supported.
.
.TP
.B "\[rs]X'ps: invis'"
Suppress output.
.
.TP
.B "\[rs]X'ps: endinvis'"
Stop suppressing output.
.
.TP
.B "\[rs]X'ps: exec gsave currentpoint 2 copy translate \fIn\fP rotate neg exch neg exch translate'"
where
.I n
is the angle of rotation.
This is to support the
.I align
command in
.BR gpic .
.
.TP
.B "\[rs]X'ps: exec grestore'"
Again used by
.B gpic
to restore after rotation.
.
.TP
.BI "\[rs]X'ps: exec " "n " "setlinejoin'"
where
.I n
can be one of the following values.
.IP
0 = Miter join
.br

.br
2 = Bevel join
.
.TP
.BI "\[rs]X'ps: exec " "n " "setlinecap'"
where

0 = Butt cap
.br
1 = Round cap, and

.LP
.TP
.B "\[rs]X'ps: ... pdfmark'"
All the
.I pdfmark
macros installed by using
.I \-m pdfmark
or
.I \-m mspdf
(see documentation in
.IR pdfmark.pdf ).
.
A subset of these macros are installed automatically when you use
.B \-Tpdf
so you should not need to use \[oq]\-m pdfmark\[cq] for using most of
the PDF functionality.
.
.LP
.B gropdf
also supports a subset of the commands introduced in present.tmac.
Specifically it supports:-
.IP
PAUSE
.br
BLOCKS
.br
BLOCKE
.
.LP
Which allows you to create presentation type PDFs.
Many of the other
commands are already available in other macro packages.
.LP
These commands are implemented with
.B groff
X commands:-
.LP
.TP
.B "\[rs]X'ps: exec %%%%PAUSE"
The section before this is treated as a block and is introduced using the
current BLOCK transition setting (see \[oq]pdf: transition\[cq] below).
This command
can be introduced using the macro
.BR .pdfpause .
.TP
.B "\[rs]X'ps: exec %%%%BEGINONCE"
Any text following this command (up to %%%%ENDONCE) is shown only once,
the next %%%%PAUSE will remove it.
If producing a non presentation pdf, i.e.\&
ignoring the pauses, see
.I \%GROPDF_NOSLIDE
below, this text is ignored.
.LP
.TP
.B "\[rs]X'ps: exec %%%%ENDONCE"
This terminates the block defined by %%%%BEGINONCE.
This pair of commands
is what implements the .BLOCKS Once/.BLOCKE commands in present.tmac.
.LP
The
.B mom
macro set already has integration with these extensions so you can build
slides with
.BR mom .
.LP
If you use present.tmac with
.B gropdf
there is no need to run the program
.BR presentps (1)
since the output will already be a presentation pdf.
.LP
All other
.B ps:
tags are silently ignored.
.
.
.LP
One
.B \[rs]X
special used by the DVI driver is also recognised:
.
.TP
.BI \[rs]X'papersize= paper-size '
where the
.I paper-size
parameter is the same as the
.B papersize
command.
.
See
.BR groff_font (5)
for details.
.
This means that you can alter the page size at will within the PDF file
being created by
.BR gropdf .
.
If you do want to change the paper size, it must be done before you start
creating the page.
.
.LP
In addition,
.B gropdf
supports its own suite of
.B pdf:
tags.
.
The following tags are supported:
.
.TP
.BI "\[rs]X'pdf: pdfpic " "file alignment width height line-length" '
Place an image of the specified
.I width
containing the PDF drawing from file
.I file
of desired
.I width
and
.I height
(if
.I height
is missing or zero then it is scaled proportionally).
.
If
.I alignment
is
.B \-L
the drawing is left aligned.
.
If it is
.B \-C
or
.B \-R
a
.I linelength
greater than the width of the drawing is required as well.
.
If
.I width
is specified as zero then the width is scaled in proportion to the height.
.

.TP
.B \[rs]X'pdf: xrev'
This toggles a flag which reverses the direction of printing
.IR "letter by letter" ,
i.e., each separate letter is reversed, not the entire word.
.
This is useful for reversing the direction of glyphs in the Dingbats font.
.
To return to normal printing repeat the command again.
.
.TP
.BI "\[rs]X'pdf: markstart " "/ANN definition" '
The macros which support PDF Bookmarks use this call internally to
start the definition of bookmark hotspot (user will have called
\[oq].pdfhref\~L\[cq] with the text which will become the \[oq]hot
spot\[cq] region).
.
Normally this is never used except from within the pdfmark macros.
.
.TP
.B \[rs]X'pdf: markend'
The macros which support PDF Bookmarks use this call internally to
stop the definition of bookmark hotspot (user will have called
\[oq].pdfhref\~L\[cq] with the text which will become the \[oq]hot
spot\[cq] region).
.
Normally this is never used except from within the pdfmark macros.
.

.B \[rs]X'pdf: markrestart'
If you are using page traps to produce headings, footings, etc., you
need to use these in case a \[oq]hot spot\[cq] crosses a page
boundary, otherwise any text output by the heading or footing macro
will be marked as part of the \[oq]hot spot\[cq].
.
To stop this happening just place \[oq].pdfmarksuspend\[cq] and
\[oq].pdfmarkrestart\[cq] at the start and end of the page trap macro,
respectively.

.SS Importing graphics
.\" ====================================================================
.
.B gropdf
only supports importing other PDF files as graphics.
.
But that PDF file may contain any of the graphic formats supported by
the PDF standard (such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.).
.
So any application which outputs PDF can be used as an embedded file
in
.BR gropdf .
.
The PDF file you wish to insert must be a single page and the drawing
must just fit inside the media size of the PDF file.
.
So, in
.BR inkscape (1)
or
.BR gimp (1)
(for example) make sure the canvas size just fits the image.
.
.
.LP
The PDF parser used in
.B gropdf
has not been rigorously tested with all possible applications which
produce PDFs.
.
If you find a single page PDF which fails to import properly, it is
worth running it through the

preceded with some binary bytes.
.
.LI
Convert the AFM file to a groff font description file with the
.BR \%afmtodit (1)
program.
.
An example call is
.
.RS
.IP
afmtodit Foo\-Bar\-Bold.afm map/textmap FBB
.RE
.
.IP
which converts the metric file \[oq]Foo\-Bar\-Bold.afm\[cq] to the groff
font \[oq]FBB\[cq].
.
If you have a font family which comes with normal, bold, italic, and
bold italic faces, it is recommended to use the letters
.BR R ,
.BR B ,
.BR I ,
and
.BR BI ,
respectively, as postfixes in the groff font names to make groff's
\[oq].fam\[cq] request work.
.
An example is groff's built-in Times-Roman font: The font family
name is
.BR T ,
and the groff font names are
.BR TR ,
.BR TB ,
.BR TI ,
and
.BR TBI .
.
.LI
Install both the groff font description files and the fonts in a
\[oq]devpdf\[cq] subdirectory of the font path which groff finds.
.
See section \[lq]Environment\[rq] in
.BR troff (1)
for the actual value of the font path.
.
Note that groff doesn't use the AFM files (but it is a good idea to
store them anyway).
.
.LI
Register all fonts which must be downloaded to the printer in the
.I devpdf/download
file.
.
Only the first occurrence of this file in the font path is read.
.
This means that you should copy the default
.I download
file to the first directory in your font path and add your fonts there.
.
To continue the above example we assume that the PS font name for
Foo\-Bar\-Bold.pfa is \[oq]XY\-Foo\-Bar\-Bold\[cq] (the PS font name is
stored in the
.B internalname
field in the
.I FBB
file) and belongs to foundry \[oq]F\[cq]
thus the following line should be added to
.IR download :
.
.RS
.IP
.B F XY\-Foo\-Bar\-Bold Foo\-Bar\-Bold.pfa
.
.
.LP
Use a tab character to separate the fields, and the \[oq]foundry\[cq]
field should be null for the default foundry.
