.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ====================================================================
.
.I pdfmom
is a wrapper around
.IR groff (1)
that facilitates the production of PDF documents from files
formatted with the
.I mom
macros.
.
.
.P
.I pdfmom
prints to the standard output,
so output must usually be redirected to a destination file.
The size of the final PDF can be reduced by piping the output
through
.IR ps2pdf (1).
.
.
.P
If called with the
.B \-Tpdf
option (which is the default),
.I pdfmom
processes files using groff's native PDF driver,
.IR gropdf (1).
.
If
.B \-Tps
is given, processing is passed over to
.IR pdfroff ,
which uses
.IR groff 's
PostScript driver.
.
In either case, multiple runs of the source file are performed in
order to satisfy any forward references in the document.
.
.
.P
.I pdfmom
accepts all the same options as
.IR groff .
If
.B \-Tps
is given, the options associated with
.I pdfroff
are accepted as well.
.
Please note that when
.I pdfmom
calls
.IR pdfroff ,
the
.RS
.B \-mpdfmark \-mom \-\-no-toc
.RE
options are implied and should not be given on the
command line.
.
Equally, it is not necessary to supply the
.B \-mom
or
.B "\-m\~mom"
options when
.B \-Tps
is absent.
.
.
.P
PDF integration with the
.I mom
macros is discussed in full in the manual
.IR "Producing PDFs with groff and mom" ,
which was itself produced with
.IR pdfmom .
.
.
.P
If called with the
.B \-v
option,
.I pdfmom
simply displays its version information and exits.
.

.SH BUGS
.\" ====================================================================
.
.I pdfmom
sometimes issues warnings of the type
.RS
\&.\|.\|.:
can't transparently output node at top level
.RE
.
but this is more of an annoyance than a bug, and may safely be ignored.
