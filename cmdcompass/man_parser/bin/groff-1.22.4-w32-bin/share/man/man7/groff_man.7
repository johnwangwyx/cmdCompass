Macros whose use we discourage
.RB ( .AT ,
.BR .BT ,
.BR .DT ,
.BR .HP ,
.BR .PD ,
.BR .PT ,
and
.BR .UC )
are described in subsection \(lqDeprecated features\(rq, below.
.
.
.\" ====================================================================
.SS "Macro reference preliminaries"
.\" ====================================================================
.
Each macro is described in a tagged paragraph.
.
Closely related macros,
such as
.B .EX
and
.BR .EE ,
are grouped together.
.
.
.PP
Optional macro arguments are indicated by surrounding them with square
brackets.
.
If a macro accepts multiple arguments,
arguments containing whitespace must be double-quoted ("one two"),
to be interpreted correctly.
.
Most macro arguments are strings that will be output as text;
exceptions are noted.
.
.
.PP
Bear in mind that
.I groff
is fundamentally a programming system for typesetting.
.
Consequently,
the verb \(lqto set\(rq is frequently used below in the sense \(lqto
typeset\(rq.
.
.
.\" ====================================================================
.SS "Document structure macros"
.\" ====================================================================
.
The highest level of organization of a man page is determined by this
group of macros.
.
.B .TH
(title heading) identifies the document as a man page and defines
information enabling its indexing by
.IR mandb (8)
or a similar tool.
.
.
Sections
.RB ( .SH ),
one of which is mandatory and many of which are standardized,
facilitate quick location of relevant material by the reader and aid
the man page writer to discuss all essential aspects of the topic.
.
Subsections
.RB ( .SS )
are optional and permit sections that grow long to develop in a
controlled way.
.
Many technical discussions require examples;
lengthy ones,
especially those reflecting multiple lines of input to or output from
the system,
are usefully bracketed by
.B .EX
and
.BR .EE .
.
When none of the foregoing meets a structural demand,
a section of the discussion can be manually indented within
.B .RS
and
.B .RE
macros.
.
.
.TP
.BI .TH " title section"\c
.RI " [" footer-middle ]\c
.RI " [" footer-outside ]\c
.RI " [" header-middle ]
Define the title of the man page as
.I title
and the section as
.IR section .
.
See
.IR man (1)
for details on the section numbers and suffixes applicable to your
system.
.
.I title
and
.I section
are positioned together at the left and right in the header line
(with
.I section
in parentheses immediately appended to
.IR title ).
.
.I footer-middle
is centered in the footer line.
.
.I footer-outside
is positioned at the left in the footer line (or at the left on
even pages and at the right on odd pages if double-sided printing is
active).
.
.I header-middle
is centered in the header line.
.
If
.I section
is a simple integer between 1 and\~9 (inclusive),
or is exactly \(lq3p\(rq,
there is no need to specify
.IR header-middle ;
the macro package will supply text for it.
.
.
.IP
For HTML output, headers and footers are completely suppressed.
.
.
.IP
Additionally, this macro starts a new page; the page number is reset
to\~1
(unless the
.B \-rC1
option is given on the command line).
.
This feature is intended only for formatting multiple man pages.
.
.
.IP
A man page should contain exactly one
.B .TH
call at or near the beginning of the file,
prior to any other macro calls.
.
.
.IP
By convention,
.I footer-middle
is the most recent modification date of the man page source document,
and
.I footer-outside
is the name and version or release of the project providing it.
.
.
.TP
.BR .SH " ["\c
.IR heading-text ]
Set
.I heading-text
as a section heading flush left.
.
The text following
.B .SH
up to the end of the line,
or the text on the next input line if
.B .SH
is given no arguments,
is set in bold
(or the font specified by the string register
.BR HF )
slightly larger than the base font size.
.
Additionally,
the left margin and indentation affecting subsequent text are reset to
their default values.
.
Text on input lines after
.I heading-text
is set as a normal paragraph
.RB ( .PP ).
.
.
.IP
The content of
.I heading-text
and ordering of sections has been standardized by common practice,
as has much of the layout of material within sections.
.
For example,
a section called \(lqName\(rq or \(lqNAME\(rq must exist,
must be the first section after the
.B .TH
call,
and must contain only a line of the form
.RS \" Invisibly move left margin to current .IP indent.
.RS \" Now indent further, visibly.

.TP
.BR .SS " ["\c
.IR subheading-text ]
Set
.I subheading-text
as a subsection heading indented (by default) partway between a section
heading and a normally-indented paragraph
.RB ( .PP ).
.
The text following
.B .SS
up to the end of the line,
or the text on the next input line if
.B .SS
is given no arguments,
is set in bold
(or the font specified by the string register
.BR HF )
at the base font size.
.
Additionally,
the left margin and indentation affecting subsequent text are reset to
their default values.
.
Text on input lines after
.I subheading-text
is set as a normal paragraph
.RB ( .PP ).

.TP
.B .EX
.TQ
.B .EE
Begin and end example.
.
After
.BR .EX ,
filling and hyphenation are disabled and a constant-width (monospaced)
font is selected.
.
Calling
.B .EE
enables filling and restores the previous hyphenation setting and font.

Calls to
.B .RS
can be nested;
each call increments by\~1 the indentation level used by

.
.\" ====================================================================
.SS "Paragraph macros"
.\" ====================================================================
.
A typical paragraph
.RB ( .PP )
is set at the current left margin,
which by default is indented from the left margin of the output device.
.
In man pages and other technical literature,
definition lists are frequently encountered;
these can be set as \(lqtagged paragraphs\(rq
.RB ( .TP
and
.BR .TQ ),
which have one or more leading tags followed by a paragraph that has an
additional left indent.
.
The indented paragraph
.RB ( .IP )
macro is useful to continue the indented content of a narrative started
with
.BR .TP ,
or to present an itemized or ordered list.
.
.
.TP
.B .LP
.TQ
.B .PP
.TQ
.B .P
Begin a new paragraph;
these macros are synonymous.
.
They break the output line at the current position,
followed by a vertical space downward by a default amount
(which can be changed by the deprecated
.B .PD
macro).
.
The font size and style are reset to defaults;
see subsection \(lqFont style macros\(rq below.
.
Finally, the left margin and indentation are reset to default values.
.
.
.TP
.BR .TP " ["\c
.IR indent ]
Set a tagged, indented paragraph.
.
The input line following this macro,
known as the
.IR tag ,
is printed at the current left margin.
.
Subsequent text is indented by
.IR indent ,
if specified,
and by a default amount otherwise;
see subsection \(lqHorizontal and vertical spacing\(rq below.
.
.
.IP
If the tag is not as wide as the indentation,
the paragraph starts on the same line as the tag,
at the applicable indentation,
and continues on the following lines.
.
Otherwise,
the descriptive part of the paragraph begins on the line following the
tag,
entirely indented.
.
The line containing the tag can include a macro call,
for instance to set the tag in bold with
.BR .B .
.
.
.IP
.B .TP

.BR .TP .
.
The pending output line is broken.

The tag on the input line following this macro and subsequent lines are
handled as with

.SS "Command synopsis macros"
.\" ====================================================================
.
Command synopses are a staple of section\~1 and\~8 man pages.
.
These macros aid you to construct one that has the classical Unix
appearance.
.
Furthermore,
some tools are able to interpret these macros semantically and treat
them appropriately for localization and/or presentation.
.
A command synopsis is wrapped in
.BR .SY / .YS
calls,
with command-line options of some formats indicated by
.BR .OP .
.

.
.
.TP
.BI .SY " command"
Begin synopsis.
.
Hyphenation is turned off.
.
The
.I command
argument is set in bold.
.
The output line is filled as normal,
but if a break is required,
subsequent output lines are indented by the width of
.I command
plus a space.
.
.
.TP
.BI .OP " option-name"\/\c
.RI " [" option-argument ]
Indicate an optional command parameter called
.IR option-name ,
which is set in bold.
.
If the option takes an argument, specify
.I option-argument
using a noun, abbreviation, or hyphenated noun phrase.
.
If present,
.I option-argument
is preceded by a space and set in italics.
.
Square brackets (in roman) surround both arguments.
.
.
.TP
.B .YS
End synopsis.
.
Restore indentation and hyphenation to previous values.
.
.
.PP
Multiple
.B .SY/.YS
blocks can be specified,
for instance to distinguish differing modes of operation of a complex
command like
.IR tar (1);
each will be separated by a paragraph space.
.
.
.PP
.B .SY
can also be repeated multiple times before a closing
.BR .YS ,

The
.I man
macro package is limited in its font styling options,
offering only
.BR bold \~( .B ),
.I italic\c
.RB \~( .I ),
and roman (the default).
.
Italic text is usually set underscored instead on terminals and other
classical
.IR nroff -style
output devices.
.
The
.B .SM
and
.B .SB
macros set text in roman or bold, respectively, at a smaller point size;
these differ visually from regular-sized roman or bold text only on
.IR troff -style
output devices.
.
The foregoing macros cause word breaks before and after their arguments,
but it is often necessary to set text in different styles without
intervening whitespace.
.
The macros
.BR .BI ,
.BR .BR ,
.BR .IB ,
.BR .IR ,
.BR .RB ,
and
.BR .RI ,

roman, respectively,
set their odd- and even-numbered arguments in alternating styles,
with no whitespace separating them.
.

Because font styles are presentational rather than semantic,
conflicting traditions have arisen regarding which font styles should be
used to mark file or path names,

The

is a number plus an optional scaling indicator.
.
If no scaling indicator is given,
the

that is,
the width of a letter \(lqn\(rq in the font current when the macro is
called.
.
See section \(lqNumerical Expressions\(rq in
.IR groff (7)
for further details.
.
An indent specified in a call to
.BR .IP ,

persists until
(1) another of these macros is called with an explicit indent
argument,
or (2)
.BR .SH ,
.BR .SS ,

these clear the indent entirely.

Indents set by

move the left margin and persist until
.BR .RS ,
.BR .RE ,

or
.B .SS
is called.
.
.
The default indentation,
exhibited by ordinary
.B .PP
paragraphs not within an

relative indent,
is 7.2n in
.I troff

This same indentation is used again (additively) for the defaults of
.BR .IP ,

.BR .HP .
.
Section headings
.RB ( .SH )
are set flush with the left margin of the output device,

Resist the temptation to mock up tabular or multi-column output with
ASCII tab characters or the indentation arguments to
.BR .IP ,

the result may not render comprehensibly on an output device you fail to

Note that the line starts with an apostrophe (\(aq),
not a dot,

consists of one letter for each needed preprocessor:
\(oqe\(cq for
.IR eqn ,
\(oqr\(cq for

\(oqt\(cq for
.IR tbl .

Modern implementations of the

.SS Portability

.
The two major syntactical categories of
.I roff
languages are requests and escapes.
.
Since the
.I man
macros are implemented in terms of
.I groff
requests and escapes,
one can,
in principle,
supplement the functionality of
.I man
with these lower-level elements where necessary.
.
.
.PP
Note,
however,
that using raw
.I groff
requests is likely to make your page render poorly on the class of
viewers that transform it to HTML.
.
Some requests make implicit assumptions about things like character
and page sizes that may not hold in an HTML environment;
also,
many of these viewers don't interpret the full
.I groff
vocabulary,
a problem that can lead to portions of your text being silently dropped.
.
.
.PP
For portability to modern viewers,
it is best to write your page entirely with the macros described in this
page
(except for the ones identified as deprecated,
which should be avoided).
.
The macros we have described as extensions
.RB ( .EX / .EE ,
.BR .SY / .OP / .YS ,
.BR .UR / .UE ,
and
.BR .MT / .ME )
should be used with caution, as they may not yet be built in to
some viewer that is important to your audience.
.
If in doubt, copy the implementation into your page\(emafter the
.B .TH
call and the \(lqName\(rq section,
to accommodate timid
.I mandb
implementations.
.
.
.PP
Similar caveats apply to escapes.
.
Some escape sequences are however required for correct typesetting
even in man pages and usually do not cause portability problems:
.
.
.TP
.B \e\(dq
Comment.
.
Everything after the double-quote to the end of the input line is
ignored.
.
Whole-line comments are frequently placed immediately after the empty
request \(oq.\(cq.
.
.
.TP
.BI \e newline
Join the next input line to the current one.
.
Except for the update of the input line counter (used for diagnostic
messages and related purposes),
a series of lines ending in backslash-newline is transparent to
.IR groff .
.
Use this escape to break excessively input long lines for document
maintenance.
.
.
.TP
.B \e\(ti
Adjustable, non-breaking space character.
.
Use this escape to prevent a break inside a short phrase or between a
numerical quantity and its corresponding unit(s).

.RS
.IP

Zero-width space.

Append to an input line to prevent an end-of-sentence punctuation
sequence from being recognized as such, or insert at the beginning of an
input line to prevent a dot or apostrophe from being interpreted as the
beginning of a
.I roff
request.
.
.
.TP
.B \e(aq
ASCII apostrophe.
.
Use for syntax elements of programming languages because some
output devices might replace unescaped apostrophes with right single
quotation marks.
.
.
.TP
.B \e(oq
Opening single quotation mark.
.
.TQ
.B \e(cq
Closing single quotation mark.
.
.
.IP
Use these for paired directional single quotes, \(oqlike this\(cq.

ASCII double-quote.

Sometimes needed after macro calls to prevent the interpretation of the
ASCII quotation mark character \(oq\(dq\(cq as the beginning or end

.B \e(lq
Left double quotation mark.

En-dash.

Use to separate the two ends of a range,

.TP
.B \e(ga
ASCII grave accent.

Use for syntax elements of programming languages,
for example shell command substitutions,
because some output devices might replace unescaped grave accents with
left single quotation marks.
.
.
.TP
.B \e(ha
ASCII circumflex accent.
.
Use for syntax elements of programming languages because some output
devices might replace unescaped circumflex accents with non-ASCII glyphs
like the Unicode U+02C6 modifier letter circumflex.
.
.
.TP
.B \e(ti
ASCII tilde.
.
Use for syntax elements of programming languages because some output
devices might replace unescaped tildes with non-ASCII glyphs like the
Unicode U+02DC small tilde.
.
.
.TP
.B \e\-
Minus sign.
.
Also use this to display syntax elements that require the ASCII
hyphen-minus character,
for example command-line options and C language operators.
.
The unescaped \(oq\-\(cq input character is not appropriate for
these cases because it may render as a hyphen on some output devices.
.
.
.TP
.B \ec
.
If this escape sequence occurs at the end of an input line, no white
space is inserted between the last glyph on it and the first glyph
resulting from the next input line.

If this option is not given, the line length is set to respect any
value set by a prior \(lq.ll\(rq request (which
.I must
be in effect when the
.B .TH
macro is invoked),
if this differs from the built-in default for the formatter;
otherwise it defaults to 78n in
.I nroff
mode and 6.5i in
.I troff
mode.
.
.
.IP
Note that the use of a \(lq.ll\(rq request to initialize the line
length is supported for backward compatibility with some versions of
the
.I man
program;
direct initialization of the
.B LL
register should
.I always
be preferred to the use of such a request.
.
In particular, note that a \(lq.ll\~65n\(rq request does
.I not
preserve the normal
.I nroff
default line length
(the
.I man
default initialization to 78n prevails),
whereas the
.B \-rLL=65n
option,
or an equivalent \(lq.nr\~LL\~65n\(rq request preceding the use of the
.B .TH
macro,
.I does
set a line length of 65n.
.
.
.TP
.BI \-rLT= title-length
Set title length.
.
If this option is not given, the title length defaults to the line
length.
.
.
.TP
.BI \-rP n
Start enumeration of pages at
.I n
rather than\~1.
.
.
.TP
.BI \-rS point-size
Use
.I point-size
as the base document font size.
.
Acceptable values are 10, 11, or 12.
.
See subsection \(lqFont style macros\(rq above for the default.
.
.
.TP
.BI \-rSN= subsection-indent
Set subsection indentation to
.IR subsection-indent .
.
See \(lqHorizontal and vertical spacing\(rq above for the default
indentation value.

.
.TP
.BI \-rX p
After
.RI page " p" ,
number pages as
.IR p a,
.IR p b,
.IR p c,
and so forth.
.
For example, the option
.B \-rX2
produces the following page
numbers: 1, 2, 2a, 2b, 2c, and so on.

This brief
.I groff
program detects whether the
.I man
or
.I mdoc
macro package is being used by a document and loads the correct macro
definitions,
taking advantage of the fact that pages using them must call
.B .TH
or
.BR .Dd ,
respectively,
as their first macro.
.
Because the wrappers above load this file,
a
.I man
program or user typing,
for example,
\(lqgroff \-man page.1\(rq,
need not know which package the file
.I page.1
uses.

Some tips on troubleshooting your man pages follow.

.TP
.RB \(bu " .RS" " doesn't indent relative to my indented paragraph"
The
.B .RS
macro sets the indentation relative to the amount of a
.I normal
paragraph
.RB ( .PP
and its synonyms).
.
The same default indentation amount is used for
.BR .RS ,
.BR .IP ,
.BR .TP ,
and the deprecated
.BR .HP .
.
If you need to start an indent relative to an indented paragraph,
call
.B .RS
repeatedly until an acceptable indentation is achieved,
or give
.B .RS
an indentation argument that is at least as much as the paragraph's
indentation amount relative to an adjacent
.B .PP
paragraph.
.
See \(lqHorizontal and vertical spacing\(rq above for the values.
.
.
.TP
.RB \(bu " .RE" " doesn't reset the indent to the expected level"
.TQ
\(bu warning: scale indicator invalid in this context
.TQ
\(bu warning: number register \(aqan\-saved\-margin\c
.IR n "\(aq not defined"
.TQ
\(bu warning: number register 'an\-saved\-prevailing\-indent\c
.IR n "\(aq not defined"
The
.B .RS
macro takes an indentation
.I amount
as an argument;
the
.B .RE
macro's argument is a specific indentation
.IR level .
.B .RE\~1
goes to the level before any
.B .RS
macros were called,
.B .RE\~2
goes to the level of the first
.B .RS
call you made,
and so forth.
.
If you desire symmetry in your macro calls,
simply issue one
.B .RE
without an argument
for each
.B .RS
that precedes it.
.
.
.IP
After calls to the
.B .SH
and
.B .SS
sectioning macros,
all relative indents are cleared and calls to
.B .RE
have no effect.
