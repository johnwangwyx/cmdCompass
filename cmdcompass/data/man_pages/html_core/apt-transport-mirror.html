<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">apt-transport-mirror
- APT transport for more automated mirror selection</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This APT
transport isn't implementing a protocol to access local or
remote repositories on its own, but acquires a mirrorlist
and redirects all requests to the mirror(s) picked from this
list, accessing them via other transports like
<b>apt-transport-http</b>(1). The basic functionality has
been available since apt 0.7.24, but was undocumented until
apt 1.6 which contained a complete rework of the transport
and its supported features. Note that a transport is never
called directly by a user but used by APT tools based on
user configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
acquisition of a file via a mirror fails, the method ensures
that another possible mirror from the list is automatically
tried until either the file is retrieved or no mirror is
left in the list, transparently handling server downtimes
and similar problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The security
implications of the transport depend on the security
considerations associated with the transport used to acquire
the mirrorlist and the transports involved in accessing the
chosen mirror(s) by the transport.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This transport
has no configuration options at present. The mirror
selection is based entirely on the mirrors offered in the
mirrorlist and the files APT needs to acquire.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mirrorlist
format</b> <br>
A mirrorlist contains one or more lines each specifying a
URI for a mirror. Empty lines and those starting with a hash
character (#) are ignored. A URI always starts with a URI
scheme which defines the transport used for this mirror. If
for example the URI starts with http:, the responsible
transport is <b>apt-transport-http</b>(1) which might have
specific requirements for the format of the remaining part
of the URI.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Metadata about
a mirror can be given on the same line, separated from the
URI by a tab. Multiple items of metadata can themselves be
separated by either tabs or spaces. (This is an advanced
feature only available with apt &gt;= 1.6. Earlier apt
versions will fail to parse mirrorlists using this
feature.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since apt 1.6
the use of compressed mirrorlists is also supported. Note
that the filename of the mirrorlist must specify the
compression algorithm used; there is no auto-detection based
on file contents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mirror
selection by metadata</b> <br>
As specified in the format, a mirror can have additional
metadata attached to prevent a mirror from being selected
for acquiring a file not matching this metadata. This way
the mirrorlist can e.g. contain partial mirrors serving only
certain architectures and APT will automatically choose a
different mirror for files requiring an unlisted
architecture. Supported are limits for the architecture
(arch), codename of the release (codename), component of the
repository the file is in (component), language the file
applies to (lang), suite name of the release (suite) and
type of the file (type).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Fallback
order for mirrors</b> <br>
If no priority is given for a mirror via the metadata key
priority, the order in which mirrors are contacted is
random. If a certain set of mirrors should be tried first
before any of another set is tried, a priority can be
explicitly set. The mirrors with the lowest number are tried
first. Mirrors which have no explicit priority set default
to the highest possible number and are therefore tried last.
The choice between mirrors with the same priority is again
random.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Allowed
transports in a mirrorlist</b> <br>
The availability and choice of transports in a mirrorlist is
limited by how the APT client is accessing the mirrorlist.
If a local transport like file or copy is used, the
mirrorlist can also include local sources, while a
mirrorlist accessed via http can not. Additionally, a
mirrorlist can not contain a mirrorlist or other wrapping
transports (like apt-transport-tor). See the documentation
of these transports on how to use them with the mirror
method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that apt
versions before 1.6 do not support any other transport than
http.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Basic
example</b> <br>
A basic mirrorlist example supported by all apt versions
with a mirror method (&gt;= 0.7.24) in which the client will
pick any of the three mirrors:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/
<br>
http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ <br>
http://deb.debian.org/debian/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assuming a file
with this content is stored as /etc/apt/mirrorlist.txt on
your machine it can be used like this in
<b>sources.list</b>(5) (since apt 1.6):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">deb
mirror+file:/etc/apt/mirrorlist.txt bookworm main</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All versions of
the mirror method support a mirrorlist accessible via HTTP,
so assuming it is available at
http://apt.example.org/mirror.lst the sources.list entry
from above could instead be written as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">deb
mirror://apt.example.org/mirror.lst bookworm main</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that since
apt 1.6 the use of mirror+http should be preferred over
mirror for uniformity. The functionality is the same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example with
metadata-enhanced mirror selection</b> <br>
As explained in the format definition apt versions before
1.6 do not support this and will fail parsing the
mirrorlist. The example mirrorlist is intentionally
complicated to show some aspects of the selection. The
following setup is assumed: The first mirror is a local
mirror accessible via the file method, but potentially
incomplete. The second mirror has a great connection, but is
a partial mirror insofar as it only contains files related
to the architectures amd64 and all. The remaining mirrors
are average mirrors which should be contacted only if the
earlier ones didn't work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this setup
with this mirrorlist the first mirror will be used to
download all index files assuming the mirrorlist itself is
accessed via a local transport like file. If it isn't, if
the mirror is otherwise inaccessible or if it does not
contain the requested file another mirror will be used to
acquire the file, chosen depending on the type of the file:
An index file will be served by the last mirror in the list,
while a package of architecture amd64 is served by the
second and those of e.g. architecture i386 by one of the
last three.</p>
