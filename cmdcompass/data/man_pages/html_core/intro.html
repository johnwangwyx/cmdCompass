<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">intro -
introduction to user commands</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Section 1 of
the manual describes user commands and tools, for example,
file manipulation tools, shells, compilers, web browsers,
file and image viewers and editors, and so on.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Linux is a
flavor of UNIX, and as a first approximation all user
commands under UNIX work precisely the same under Linux (and
FreeBSD and lots of other UNIX-like systems).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under Linux,
there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces), where you can
point and click and drag, and hopefully get work done
without first reading lots of documentation. The traditional
UNIX environment is a CLI (command line interface), where
you type commands to tell the computer what to do. That is
faster and more powerful, but requires finding out what the
commands are. Below a bare minimum, to get started.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Login</b>
<br>
In order to start working, you probably first have to open a
session by giving your username and password. The program
<b>login</b>(1) now starts a <i>shell</i> (command
interpreter) for you. In case of a graphical login, you get
a screen with menus or icons and a mouse click will start a
shell in a window. See also <b>xterm</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
shell</b> <br>
One types commands to the <i>shell</i>, the command
interpreter. It is not built-in, but is just a program and
you can change your shell. Everybody has their own favorite
one. The standard one is called <i>sh</i>. See also
<b>ash</b>(1), <b>bash</b>(1), <b>chsh</b>(1),
<b>csh</b>(1), <b>dash</b>(1), <b>ksh</b>(1),
<b>zsh</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A session might
go like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here typing
Control-D ended the session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>$</b>
here was the command prompt&mdash;it is the shell&rsquo;s
way of indicating that it is ready for the next command. The
prompt can be customized in lots of ways, and one might
include stuff like username, machine name, current
directory, time, and so on. An assignment PS1=&quot;What
next, master? &quot; would change the prompt as
indicated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We see that
there are commands <i>date</i> (that gives date and time),
and <i>cal</i> (that gives a calendar).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<i>ls</i> lists the contents of the current
directory&mdash;it tells you what files you have. With a
<i>-l</i> option it gives a long listing, that includes the
owner and size and date of the file, and the permissions
people have for reading and/or changing the file. For
example, the file &quot;tel&quot; here is 37 bytes long,
owned by aeb and the owner can read and write it, others can
only read it. Owner and permissions can be changed by the
commands <i>chown</i> and <i>chmod</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<i>cat</i> will show the contents of a file. (The name is
from &quot;concatenate and print&quot;: all files given as
parameters are concatenated and sent to &quot;standard
output&quot; (see <b>stdout</b>(3)), here the terminal
screen.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<i>cp</i> (from &quot;copy&quot;) will copy a file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<i>mv</i> (from &quot;move&quot;), on the other hand, only
renames it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<i>diff</i> lists the differences between two files. Here
there was no output because there were no differences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<i>rm</i> (from &quot;remove&quot;) deletes the file, and be
careful! it is gone. No wastepaper basket or anything.
Deleted means lost.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<i>grep</i> (from &quot;g/re/p&quot;) finds occurrences of a
string in one or more files. Here it finds Maja&rsquo;s
telephone number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pathnames
and the current directory</b> <br>
Files live in a large tree, the file hierarchy. Each has a
<i>pathname</i> describing the path from the root of the
tree (which is called <i>/</i>) to the file. For example,
such a full pathname might be <i>/home/aeb/tel</i>. Always
using full pathnames would be inconvenient, and the name of
a file in the current directory may be abbreviated by giving
only the last component. That is why <i>/home/aeb/tel</i>
can be abbreviated to <i>tel</i> when the current directory
is <i>/home/aeb</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<i>pwd</i> prints the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<i>cd</i> changes the current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Try
alternatively <i>cd</i> and <i>pwd</i> commands and explore
<i>cd</i> usage: &quot;cd&quot;, &quot;cd .&quot;, &quot;cd
..&quot;, &quot;cd /&quot;, and &quot;cd ~&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Directories</b>
<br>
The command <i>mkdir</i> makes a new directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<i>rmdir</i> removes a directory if it is empty, and
complains otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
<i>find</i> (with a rather baroque syntax) will find files
with given name or other properties. For example, &quot;find
. -name tel&quot; would find the file <i>tel</i> starting in
the present directory (which is called <i>.</i>). And
&quot;find / -name tel&quot; would do the same, but starting
at the root of the tree. Large searches on a multi-GB disk
will be time-consuming, and it may be better to use
<b>locate</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Disks and
filesystems</b> <br>
The command <i>mount</i> will attach the filesystem found on
some disk (or floppy, or CDROM or so) to the big filesystem
hierarchy. And <i>umount</i> detaches it again. The command
<i>df</i> will tell you how much of your disk is still
free.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Processes</b>
<br>
On a UNIX system many user and system processes run
simultaneously. The one you are talking to runs in the
<i>foreground</i>, the others in the <i>background</i>. The
command <i>ps</i> will show you which processes are active
and what numbers these processes have. The command
<i>kill</i> allows you to get rid of them. Without option
this is a friendly request: please go away. And &quot;kill
-9&quot; followed by the number of the process is an
immediate kill. Foreground processes can often be killed by
typing Control-C.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Getting
information</b> <br>
There are thousands of commands, each with many options.
Traditionally commands are documented on <i>man pages</i>,
(like this one), so that the command &quot;man kill&quot;
will document the use of the command &quot;kill&quot; (and
&quot;man man&quot; document the command &quot;man&quot;).
The program <i>man</i> sends the text through some
<i>pager</i>, usually <i>less</i>. Hit the space bar to get
the next page, hit q to quit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In
documentation it is customary to refer to man pages by
giving the name and section number, as in <b>man</b>(1). Man
pages are terse, and allow you to find quickly some
forgotten detail. For newcomers an introductory text with
more examples and explanations is useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A lot of
GNU/FSF software is provided with info files. Type
&quot;info info&quot; for an introduction on the use of the
program <i>info</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Special topics
are often treated in HOWTOs. Look in
<i>/usr/share/doc/howto/en</i> and use a browser if you find
HTML files there.</p>
