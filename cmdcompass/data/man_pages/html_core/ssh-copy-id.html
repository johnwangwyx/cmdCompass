<p>SSH-COPY-ID(1) BSD General Commands Manual
SSH-COPY-ID(1)</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>NAME</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:6%;"><b>ssh-copy-id</b> &mdash; use
locally available keys to authorise logins on a remote
machine</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>SYNOPSIS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>ssh-copy-id</b> [<b>-f</b>]
[<b>-n</b>] [<b>-s</b>]
[<b>-i&nbsp;</b>[<i>identity_file</i>]]
[<b>-p&nbsp;</b><i>port</i>]
[<b>-o&nbsp;</b><i>ssh_option</i>]
[<i>user</i>@]<i>hostname</i> <b><br>
ssh-copy-id -h</b> | <b>-</b>?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>DESCRIPTION</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:6%;"><b>ssh-copy-id</b> is a script
that uses ssh(1) to log into a remote machine (presumably
using a login password, so password authentication should be
enabled, unless you&rsquo;ve done some clever use of
multiple identities). It assembles a list of one or more
fingerprints (as described below) and tries to log in with
each key, to see if any of them are already installed (of
course, if you are not using ssh-agent(1) this may result in
you being repeatedly prompted for pass-phrases). It then
assembles a list of those that failed to log in, and using
ssh, enables logins with those keys on the remote server. By
default it adds the keys by appending them to the remote
user&rsquo;s <i>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</i> (creating the
file, and directory, if necessary). It is also capable of
detecting if the remote system is a NetScreen, and using its
&rsquo;set ssh pka-dsa key ...&rsquo; command instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">The options are
as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-i</b>
<i>identity_file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use only the key(s) contained
in <i>identity_file</i> (rather than looking for identities
via ssh-add(1) or in the <b>default_ID_file</b>). If the
filename does not end in <i>.pub</i> this is added. If the
filename is omitted, the <b>default_ID_file</b> is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
can be used to ensure that the keys copied have the comment
one prefers and/or extra options applied, by ensuring that
the key file has these set as preferred before the copy is
attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-f</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Forced mode:
doesn&rsquo;t check if the keys are present on the remote
server. This means that it does not need the private key. Of
course, this can result in more than one copy of the key
being installed on the remote system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">do a dry-run.
Instead of installing keys on the remote system simply
prints the key(s) that would have been installed.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-s</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">SFTP mode:
usually the public keys are installed by executing commands
on the remote side. With this option the user&rsquo;s
<i>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</i> file will be downloaded,
modified locally and uploaded with sftp. This option is
useful if the server has restrictions on commands which can
be used on the remote side.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-h</b>, <b>-</b>?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Print Usage
summary</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-p</b> <i>port</i>, <b>-o</b>
<i>ssh_option</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These two options are simply
passed through untouched, along with their argument, to
allow one to set the port or other ssh(1) options,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Rather than
specifying these as command line options, it is often better
to use (per-host) settings in ssh(1)&rsquo;s configuration
file: ssh_config(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">Default
behaviour without <b>-i</b>, is to check if &rsquo;ssh-add
-L&rsquo; provides any output, and if so those keys are
used. Note that this results in the comment on the key being
the filename that was given to ssh-add(1) when the key was
loaded into your ssh-agent(1) rather than the comment
contained in that file, which is a bit of a shame.
Otherwise, if ssh-add(1) provides no keys contents of the
<b>default_ID_file</b> will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>default_ID_file</b> is the most recent file that matches:
<i>~/.ssh/id*.pub</i>, (excluding those that match
<i>~/.ssh/*-cert.pub</i>) so if you create a key that is not
the one you want <b>ssh-copy-id</b> to use, just use
touch(1) on your preferred key&rsquo;s <i>.pub</i> file to
reinstate it as the most recent.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>EXAMPLES</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:6%;">If you have already installed
keys from one system on a lot of remote hosts, and you then
create a new key, on a new client machine, say, it can be
difficult to keep track of which systems on which
you&rsquo;ve installed the new key. One way of dealing with
this is to load both the new key and old key(s) into your
ssh-agent(1). Load the new key first, without the <b>-c</b>
option, then load one or more old keys into the agent,
possibly by ssh-ing to the client machine that has that old
key, using the <b>-A</b> option to allow agent
forwarding:</p>


<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">user@newclient$
ssh-add <br>
user@newclient$ ssh -A old.client <br>
user@oldl$ ssh-add -c <br>
... prompt for pass-phrase ... <br>
user@old$ logoff <br>
user@newclient$ ssh someserver</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">now, if the new
key is installed on the server, you&rsquo;ll be allowed in
unprompted, whereas if you only have the old key(s) enabled,
you&rsquo;ll be asked for confirmation, which is your cue to
log back out and run</p>


<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">user@newclient$
ssh-copy-id -i someserver</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">The reason you
might want to specify the -i option in this case is to
ensure that the comment on the installed key is the one from
the <i>.pub</i> file, rather than just the filename that was
loaded into your agent. It also ensures that only the id you
intended is installed, rather than all the keys that you
have in your ssh-agent(1). Of course, you can specify
another id, or use the contents of the ssh-agent(1) as you
prefer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:6%; margin-top: 1em">Having mentioned
ssh-add(1)&rsquo;s <b>-c</b> option, you might consider
using this whenever using agent forwarding to avoid your key
being hijacked, but it is much better to instead use
ssh(1)&rsquo;s <i>ProxyCommand</i> and <b>-W</b> option, to
bounce through remote servers while always doing direct
end-to-end authentication. This way the middle hop(s)
don&rsquo;t get access to your ssh-agent(1). A web search
for &rsquo;ssh proxycommand nc&rsquo; should prove
enlightening (N.B. the modern approach is to use the
<b>-W</b> option, rather than nc(1)).</p>
