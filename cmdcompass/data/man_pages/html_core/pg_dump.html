<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_dump is a
utility for backing up a PostgreSQL database. It makes
consistent backups even if the database is being used
concurrently. pg_dump does not block other users accessing
the database (readers or writers).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pg_dump only
dumps a single database. To back up an entire cluster, or to
back up global objects that are common to all databases in a
cluster (such as roles and tablespaces), use
<b>pg_dumpall</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Dumps can be
output in script or archive file formats. Script dumps are
plain-text files containing the SQL commands required to
reconstruct the database to the state it was in at the time
it was saved. To restore from such a script, feed it to
<b>psql</b>(1). Script files can be used to reconstruct the
database even on other machines and other architectures;
with some modifications, even on other SQL database
products.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The alternative
archive file formats must be used with <b>pg_restore</b>(1)
to rebuild the database. They allow pg_restore to be
selective about what is restored, or even to reorder the
items prior to being restored. The archive file formats are
designed to be portable across architectures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
one of the archive file formats and combined with
pg_restore, pg_dump provides a flexible archival and
transfer mechanism. pg_dump can be used to backup an entire
database, then pg_restore can be used to examine the archive
and/or select which parts of the database are to be
restored. The most flexible output file formats are the
&ldquo;custom&rdquo; format (<b>-Fc</b>) and the
&ldquo;directory&rdquo; format (<b>-Fd</b>). They allow for
selection and reordering of all archived items, support
parallel restoration, and are compressed by default. The
&ldquo;directory&rdquo; format is the only format that
supports parallel dumps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While running
pg_dump, one should examine the output for any warnings
(printed on standard error), especially in light of the
limitations listed below.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
command-line options control the content and format of the
output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>dbname</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies the name of the
database to be dumped. If this is not specified, the
environment variable <b>PGDATABASE</b> is used. If that is
not set, the user name specified for the connection is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-a <br>
--data-only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Dump only the data, not the
schema (data definitions). Table data, large objects, and
sequence values are dumped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
similar to, but for historical reasons not identical to,
specifying <b>--section=data</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-b <br>
--blobs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Include large objects in the
dump. This is the default behavior except when
<b>--schema</b>, <b>--table</b>, or <b>--schema-only</b> is
specified. The <b>-b</b> switch is therefore only useful to
add large objects to dumps where a specific schema or table
has been requested. Note that blobs are considered data and
therefore will be included when <b>--data-only</b> is used,
but not when <b>--schema-only</b> is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-B <br>
--no-blobs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Exclude large objects in the
dump.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When both
<b>-b</b> and <b>-B</b> are given, the behavior is to output
large objects, when data is being dumped, see the <b>-b</b>
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-c <br>
--clean</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Output commands to <b>DROP</b>
all the dumped database objects prior to outputting the
commands for creating them. This option is useful when the
restore is to overwrite an existing database. If any of the
objects do not exist in the destination database, ignorable
error messages will be reported during restore, unless
<b>--if-exists</b> is also specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
ignored when emitting an archive (non-text) output file. For
the archive formats, you can specify the option when you
call <b>pg_restore</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-C <br>
--create</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Begin the output with a command
to create the database itself and reconnect to the created
database. (With a script of this form, it doesn't matter
which database in the destination installation you connect
to before running the script.) If <b>--clean</b> is also
specified, the script drops and recreates the target
database before reconnecting to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>--create</b>, the output also includes the database's
comment if any, and any configuration variable settings that
are specific to this database, that is, any <b>ALTER
DATABASE ... SET ...</b> and <b>ALTER ROLE ... IN DATABASE
... SET ...</b> commands that mention this database. Access
privileges for the database itself are also dumped, unless
<b>--no-acl</b> is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
ignored when emitting an archive (non-text) output file. For
the archive formats, you can specify the option when you
call <b>pg_restore</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-e</b>
<i>pattern</i> <b><br>
--extension=</b><i>pattern</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Dump only extensions matching
<i>pattern</i>. When this option is not specified, all
non-system extensions in the target database will be dumped.
Multiple extensions can be selected by writing multiple
<b>-e</b> switches. The <i>pattern</i> parameter is
interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by
psql's \d commands (see Patterns), so multiple extensions
can also be selected by writing wildcard characters in the
pattern. When using wildcards, be careful to quote the
pattern if needed to prevent the shell from expanding the
wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Any
configuration relation registered by
<b>pg_extension_config_dump</b> is included in the dump if
its extension is specified by <b>--extension</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
When <b>-e</b> is specified, pg_dump makes no attempt to
dump any other database objects that the selected
extension(s) might depend upon. Therefore, there is no
guarantee that the results of a specific-extension dump can
be successfully restored by themselves into a clean
database.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>-E</big></b>
<big><i>encoding</i> <b><br>
--encoding=</b><i>encoding</i></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Create the dump in the
specified character set encoding. By default, the dump is
created in the database encoding. (Another way to get the
same result is to set the <b>PGCLIENTENCODING</b>
environment variable to the desired dump encoding.) The
supported encodings are described in
Section&nbsp;24.3.1.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>-f</b>
<i>file</i> <b><br>
--file=</b><i>file</i></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Send output to the
specified file. This parameter can be omitted for file based
output formats, in which case the standard output is used.
It must be given for the directory output format however,
where it specifies the target directory instead of a file.
In this case the directory is created by <b>pg_dump</b> and
must not exist before.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>-F</b>
<i>format</i> <b><br>
--format=</b><i>format</i></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Selects the format of the
output. <i>format</i> can be one of the following:</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>p <br>
plain</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><big>Output a plain-text SQL
script file (the default).</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>c <br>
custom</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><big>Output a custom-format
archive suitable for input into pg_restore. Together with
the directory output format, this is the most flexible
output format in that it allows manual selection and
reordering of archived items during restore. This format is
also compressed by default.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>d <br>
directory</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><big>Output a directory-format
archive suitable for input into pg_restore. This will create
a directory with one file for each table and blob being
dumped, plus a so-called Table of Contents file describing
the dumped objects in a machine-readable format that
pg_restore can read. A directory format archive can be
manipulated with standard Unix tools; for example, files in
an uncompressed archive can be compressed with the gzip
tool. This format is compressed by default and also supports
parallel dumps.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>t <br>
tar</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><big>Output a <b>tar</b>-format
archive suitable for input into pg_restore. The tar format
is compatible with the directory format: extracting a
tar-format archive produces a valid directory-format
archive. However, the tar format does not support
compression. Also, when using tar format the relative order
of table data items cannot be changed during
restore.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>-j</b>
<i>njobs</i> <b><br>
--jobs=</b><i>njobs</i></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Run the dump in parallel
by dumping <i>njobs</i> tables simultaneously. This option
may reduce the time needed to perform the dump but it also
increases the load on the database server. You can only use
this option with the directory output format because this is
the only output format where multiple processes can write
their data at the same time.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>pg_dump
will open <i>njobs</i> + 1 connections to the database, so
make sure your max_connections setting is high enough to
accommodate all connections.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Requesting
exclusive locks on database objects while running a parallel
dump could cause the dump to fail. The reason is that the
pg_dump leader process requests shared locks (ACCESS SHARE)
on the objects that the worker processes are going to dump
later in order to make sure that nobody deletes them and
makes them go away while the dump is running. If another
client then requests an exclusive lock on a table, that lock
will not be granted but will be queued waiting for the
shared lock of the leader process to be released.
Consequently any other access to the table will not be
granted either and will queue after the exclusive lock
request. This includes the worker process trying to dump the
table. Without any precautions this would be a classic
deadlock situation. To detect this conflict, the pg_dump
worker process requests another shared lock using the NOWAIT
option. If the worker process is not granted this shared
lock, somebody else must have requested an exclusive lock in
the meantime and there is no way to continue with the dump,
so pg_dump has no choice but to abort the dump.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>To perform
a parallel dump, the database server needs to support
synchronized snapshots, a feature that was introduced in
PostgreSQL 9.2 for primary servers and 10 for standbys. With
this feature, database clients can ensure they see the same
data set even though they use different connections.
<b>pg_dump -j</b> uses multiple database connections; it
connects to the database once with the leader process and
once again for each worker job. Without the synchronized
snapshot feature, the different worker jobs wouldn't be
guaranteed to see the same data in each connection, which
could lead to an inconsistent backup.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>-n</b>
<i>pattern</i> <b><br>
--schema=</b><i>pattern</i></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Dump only schemas matching
<i>pattern</i>; this selects both the schema itself, and all
its contained objects. When this option is not specified,
all non-system schemas in the target database will be
dumped. Multiple schemas can be selected by writing multiple
<b>-n</b> switches. The <i>pattern</i> parameter is
interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by
psql's \d commands (see Patterns below), so multiple schemas
can also be selected by writing wildcard characters in the
pattern. When using wildcards, be careful to quote the
pattern if needed to prevent the shell from expanding the
wildcards; see Examples below.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
When <b>-n</b> is specified, pg_dump makes no attempt to
dump any other database objects that the selected schema(s)
might depend upon. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the
results of a specific-schema dump can be successfully
restored by themselves into a clean database.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
Non-schema objects such as blobs are not dumped when
<b>-n</b> is specified. You can add blobs back to the dump
with the <b>--blobs</b> switch.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b><big>-N</big></b>
<big><i>pattern</i> <b><br>
--exclude-schema=</b><i>pattern</i></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big>Do not dump any
schemas matching <i>pattern</i>. The pattern is interpreted
according to the same rules as for <b>-n</b>. <b>-N</b> can
be given more than once to exclude schemas matching any of
several patterns.</big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big>When
both <b>-n</b> and <b>-N</b> are given, the behavior is to
dump just the schemas that match at least one <b>-n</b>
switch but no <b>-N</b> switches. If <b>-N</b> appears
without <b>-n</b>, then schemas matching <b>-N</b> are
excluded from what is otherwise a normal
dump.</big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><b>-O
<br>
--no-owner</b></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big>Do not output
commands to set ownership of objects to match the original
database. By default, pg_dump issues <b>ALTER OWNER</b> or
<b>SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION</b> statements to set ownership
of created database objects. These statements will fail when
the script is run unless it is started by a superuser (or
the same user that owns all of the objects in the script).
To make a script that can be restored by any user, but will
give that user ownership of all the objects, specify
<b>-O</b>.</big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big>This
option is ignored when emitting an archive (non-text) output
file. For the archive formats, you can specify the option
when you call <b>pg_restore</b>.</big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><b>-R
<br>
--no-reconnect</b></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big>This option is
obsolete but still accepted for backwards
compatibility.</big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><b>-s
<br>
--schema-only</b></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big>Dump only the object
definitions (schema), not data.</big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big>This
option is the inverse of <b>--data-only</b>. It is similar
to, but for historical reasons not identical to, specifying
<b>--section=pre-data
--section=post-data</b>.</big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big>(Do
not confuse this with the <b>--schema</b> option, which uses
the word &ldquo;schema&rdquo; in a different
meaning.)</big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big>To
exclude table data for only a subset of tables in the
database, see <b>--exclude-table-data</b>.</big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><b>-S</b>
<i>username</i> <b><br>
--superuser=</b><i>username</i></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big>Specify the superuser
user name to use when disabling triggers. This is relevant
only if <b>--disable-triggers</b> is used. (Usually, it's
better to leave this out, and instead start the resulting
script as superuser.)</big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><b>-t</b>
<i>pattern</i> <b><br>
--table=</b><i>pattern</i></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big>Dump only tables with
names matching <i>pattern</i>. Multiple tables can be
selected by writing multiple <b>-t</b> switches. The
<i>pattern</i> parameter is interpreted as a pattern
according to the same rules used by psql's \d commands (see
Patterns below), so multiple tables can also be selected by
writing wildcard characters in the pattern. When using
wildcards, be careful to quote the pattern if needed to
prevent the shell from expanding the wildcards; see Examples
below.</big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big>As
well as tables, this option can be used to dump the
definition of matching views, materialized views, foreign
tables, and sequences. It will not dump the contents of
views or materialized views, and the contents of foreign
tables will only be dumped if the corresponding foreign
server is specified with
<b>--include-foreign-data</b>.</big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big>The
<b>-n</b> and <b>-N</b> switches have no effect when
<b>-t</b> is used, because tables selected by <b>-t</b> will
be dumped regardless of those switches, and non-table
objects will not be dumped.</big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
When <b>-t</b> is specified, pg_dump makes no attempt to
dump any other database objects that the selected table(s)
might depend upon. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the
results of a specific-table dump can be successfully
restored by themselves into a clean
database.</big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><b><big>-T</big></b>
<big><i>pattern</i> <b><br>
--exclude-table=</b><i>pattern</i></big></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big><big>Do not dump any
tables matching <i>pattern</i>. The pattern is interpreted
according to the same rules as for <b>-t</b>. <b>-T</b> can
be given more than once to exclude tables matching any of
several patterns.</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big>When
both <b>-t</b> and <b>-T</b> are given, the behavior is to
dump just the tables that match at least one <b>-t</b>
switch but no <b>-T</b> switches. If <b>-T</b> appears
without <b>-t</b>, then tables matching <b>-T</b> are
excluded from what is otherwise a normal
dump.</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><b>-v
<br>
--verbose</b></big></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big><big>Specifies
verbose mode. This will cause pg_dump to output detailed
object comments and start/stop times to the dump file, and
progress messages to standard error. Repeating the option
causes additional debug-level messages to appear on standard
error.</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><b>-V
<br>
--version</b></big></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big><big>Print the
pg_dump version and exit.</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><b>-x
<br>
--no-privileges <br>
--no-acl</b></big></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big><big>Prevent dumping
of access privileges (grant/revoke
commands).</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><b>-Z</b>
<i>0..9</i> <b><br>
--compress=</b><i>0..9</i></big></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big><big>Specify the
compression level to use. Zero means no compression. For the
custom and directory archive formats, this specifies
compression of individual table-data segments, and the
default is to compress at a moderate level. For plain text
output, setting a nonzero compression level causes the
entire output file to be compressed, as though it had been
fed through gzip; but the default is not to compress. The
tar archive format currently does not support compression at
all.</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><b>--binary-upgrade</b></big></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big><big>This option is
for use by in-place upgrade utilities. Its use for other
purposes is not recommended or supported. The behavior of
the option may change in future releases without
notice.</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><b>--column-inserts
<br>
--attribute-inserts</b></big></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big><big>Dump data as
<b>INSERT</b> commands with explicit column names (INSERT
INTO <i>table</i> (<i>column</i>, ...) VALUES ...). This
will make restoration very slow; it is mainly useful for
making dumps that can be loaded into non-PostgreSQL
databases. Any error during restoring will cause only rows
that are part of the problematic <b>INSERT</b> to be lost,
rather than the entire table contents.</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><b>--disable-dollar-quoting</b></big></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big><big>This option
disables the use of dollar quoting for function bodies, and
forces them to be quoted using SQL standard string
syntax.</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><b>--disable-triggers</b></big></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big><big>This option is
relevant only when creating a data-only dump. It instructs
pg_dump to include commands to temporarily disable triggers
on the target tables while the data is restored. Use this if
you have referential integrity checks or other triggers on
the tables that you do not want to invoke during data
restore.</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big>Presently,
the commands emitted for <b>--disable-triggers</b> must be
done as superuser. So, you should also specify a superuser
name with <b>-S</b>, or preferably be careful to start the
resulting script as a superuser.</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big>This
option is ignored when emitting an archive (non-text) output
file. For the archive formats, you can specify the option
when you call <b>pg_restore</b>.</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><b>--enable-row-security</b></big></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big><big>This option is
relevant only when dumping the contents of a table which has
row security. By default, pg_dump will set row_security to
off, to ensure that all data is dumped from the table. If
the user does not have sufficient privileges to bypass row
security, then an error is thrown. This parameter instructs
pg_dump to set row_security to on instead, allowing the user
to dump the parts of the contents of the table that they
have access to.</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big>Note
that if you use this option currently, you probably also
want the dump be in <b>INSERT</b> format, as the <b>COPY
FROM</b> during restore does not support row
security.</big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><b>--exclude-table-data=</b><i>pattern</i></big></big></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><big><big>Do not dump data
for any tables matching <i>pattern</i>. The pattern is

be useful when restoring data on a server where rows do not
always fall into the same partitions as they did on the

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><big>This

for disaster recovery. It could be useful for a dump used to
load a copy of the database for reporting or other read-only
load sharing while the original database continues to be

not consistent with any serial execution of the transactions
eventually committed. For example, if batch processing
techniques are used, a batch may show as closed in the dump
without all of the items which are in the batch
appearing.</big></big></big></big></p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><big>pg_dump
internally executes <b>SELECT</b> statements. If you have
problems running pg_dump, make sure you are able to select
information from the database using, for example,
<b>psql</b>(1). Also, any default connection settings and
environment variables used by the libpq front-end library
will apply.</big></big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><big>The
database activity of pg_dump is normally collected by the
cumulative statistics system. If this is undesirable, you
can set parameter <i>track_counts</i> to false via
<b>PGOPTIONS</b> or the ALTER USER
command.</big></big></big></big></p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><big>If
your database cluster has any local additions to the
template1 database, be careful to restore the output of
pg_dump into a truly empty database; otherwise you are
likely to get errors due to duplicate definitions of the
added objects. To make an empty database without any local
additions, copy from template0 not template1, for
example:</big></big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><big>CREATE
DATABASE foo WITH TEMPLATE
template0;</big></big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><big>When
a data-only dump is chosen and the option
<b>--disable-triggers</b> is used, pg_dump emits commands to
disable triggers on user tables before inserting the data,
and then commands to re-enable them after the data has been
inserted. If the restore is stopped in the middle, the
system catalogs might be left in the wrong
state.</big></big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><big>The
dump file produced by pg_dump does not contain the
statistics used by the optimizer to make query planning
decisions. Therefore, it is wise to run <b>ANALYZE</b> after
restoring from a dump file to ensure optimal performance;
see Section&nbsp;25.1.3 and Section&nbsp;25.1.6 for more
information.</big></big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><big>Because
pg_dump is used to transfer data to newer versions of
PostgreSQL, the output of pg_dump can be expected to load
into PostgreSQL server versions newer than pg_dump's
version. pg_dump can also dump from PostgreSQL servers older
than its own version. (Currently, servers back to version
9.2 are supported.) However, pg_dump cannot dump from
PostgreSQL servers newer than its own major version; it will
refuse to even try, rather than risk making an invalid dump.
Also, it is not guaranteed that pg_dump's output can be
loaded into a server of an older major version &mdash; not
even if the dump was taken from a server of that version.
Loading a dump file into an older server may require manual
editing of the dump file to remove syntax not understood by
the older server. Use of the <b>--quote-all-identifiers</b>
option is recommended in cross-version cases, as it can
prevent problems arising from varying reserved-word lists in
different PostgreSQL versions.</big></big></big></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><big><big><big>When
dumping logical replication subscriptions, pg_dump will
generate <b>CREATE SUBSCRIPTION</b> commands that use the
connect = false option, so that restoring the subscription
does not make remote connections for creating a replication
slot or for initial table copy. That way, the dump can be
restored without requiring network access to the remote
servers. It is then up to the user to reactivate the
subscriptions in a suitable way. If the involved hosts have
changed, the connection information might have to be
changed. It might also be appropriate to truncate the target
tables before initiating a new full table copy. If users
intend to copy initial data during refresh they must create
the slot with two_phase = false. After the initial sync, the
two_phase option will be automatically enabled by the
subscriber if the subscription had been originally created
with two_phase = true option.</big></big></big></big></p>
