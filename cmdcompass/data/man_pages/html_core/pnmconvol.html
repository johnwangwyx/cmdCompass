<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pnmconvol</b>
reads a Netpbm image as input, convolves it with a specified
convolution matrix, and writes a Netpbm image as output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A command use
for convolution is blurring. See examples in the
<b>pamgauss</b>(1) manual.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Convolution
means replacing each pixel with a weighted average of the
nearby pixels. The weights and the area to average are
determined by the convolution matrix (sometimes called a
convolution kernel), which you supply in one of several
ways. See <a href="#convolmatrix"> Convolution Matrix</a>
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At the edges of
the convolved image, where the convolution matrix would
extend over the edge of the image, <b>pnmconvol</b> just
copies the input pixels directly to the output. It&rsquo;s
often better to deal with the pixels near an edge by
assuming some blank or background color beyond the edge. To
do that, use <b>pnmpad</b> to add a margin all around whose
size is half that of your convolution matrix size, not
counting its center, in the same dimension. (E.g. if your
convolution matrix is 5 wide by 3 high, use pnmpad -left=2
-right=2 -top=1 -bottom=1). Feed that enlarged image to
<b>pnmconvol</b>, then use <b>pamcut</b> to chop the edges
off the convolved output, getting back to your original
image dimensions. (E.g. pamcut -left=2 -right=-2 -top=1
-bottom=-1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The convolution
computation can result in a value which is outside the range
representable in the output. When that happens,
<b>pnmconvol</b> just clips the output, which means
brightness is not conserved.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To avoid
clipping, you may want to scale your input values. For
example, if your convolution matrix might produce an output
value as much as double the maximum value in the input, then
make sure the maxval of the input (which is also the maxval
of the output) is at least twice the actual maximum value in
the input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Clipping
negative numbers deserves special consideration. If your
convolution matrix includes negative numbers, it is possible
for <b>pnmconvol</b> to calculate an output pixel as a
negative value, which <b>pnmconvol</b> would of course clip
to zero, since Netpbm formats cannot represent negative
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Convolution
Matrix</b> <br>
There are three ways to specify the convolution matrix:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>directly with a <b>-matrix</b> option.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>In a file (or set of them) named by a <b>-matrixfile</b>
option, whose contents are similar to a <b>-matrix</b>
option value.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>With a special PNM file.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The PNM file
option is the hardest, and exists only because until Netpbm
10.49 (December 2009), it was the only way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The regular
convolution matrix file is slightly easier to read than the
<b>-matrix</b> option value, and makes your command line
less messy, but requires you to manage a separate file. With
the file, you can have separate convolution matrices for the
individual color components, which you can&rsquo;t do with
<b>-matrix</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In any case,
the convolution matrix <b>pnmconvol</b> uses is a matrix of
real numbers. They can be whole or fractional, positive,
negative, or zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The convolution
matrix always has an odd width and height, so that there is
a center element. <b>pnmconvol</b> figuratively places that
center element over a pixel of the input image and weights
that pixel and its neighbors as indicated by the convolution
matrix to produce the pixel in the same location of the
output image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a normal
convolution, where you&rsquo;re neither adding nor
subtracting total value from the image, but merely moving it
around, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure that all the numbers
in the matrix add up to 1. If they don&rsquo;t,
<b>pnmconvol</b> warns you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The elements of
the matrix are actually tuples, one for each sample in the
input. (I.e. if the input is an RGB image, each element of
the convolution matrix has one weight for red, one for
green, and one for blue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Directly On
the Command Line</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are
examples of a <b>-matrix</b> option:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-matrix=0,.2,0;.2,.2,.2;0,.2,0</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-matrix=-1,3,-1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The value
consists of each row of the matrix from top to bottom,
separated by semicolons. Each row consists of the elements
of the row from left to right, separated by commas. You must
of course have the same number of elements in each row. Each
element is a decimal floating point number and is the weight
to give to each component of a pixel that corresponds to
that matrix location.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that when
you supply this option via a shell, semicolon
(&quot;;&quot;) probably means something to the shell, so
use quotation marks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no way
with this method to have different weights for different
components of a pixel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-normalize</b> option is often quite handy with
<b>-matrix</b> because it lets you quickly throw together
the command without working out the math to make sure the
matrix isn&rsquo;t biased. Note that if you use the
<b>-normalize</b> option, the weights in the matrix
aren&rsquo;t actually the numbers you specify in the
<b>-matrix</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Regular
Matrix File</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Specify the
name of the matrix file with a <b>-matrixfile</b> option. Or
specify a list of them, one for each plane of the image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-matrixfile=mymatrix</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">-matrixfile=myred,mygreen,myblue</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each file
applies to one plane of the image (e.g. red, green, or
blue), in order. The matrix in each file must have the same
dimensions. If the input image has more planes than the
number of files you specify, the first file applies to the
extra planes as well.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pnmconvol</b>
interprets the file as text, with lines delimited by Unix
newline characters (line feeds).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each line of
the file is one row of the matrix, in order from top to
bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For each row,
the file contains a floating point decimal number for each
element in the row, from left to right, separated by spaces.
This is not just any old white space -- it is exactly one
space. Two spaces in a row mean you&rsquo;ve specified a
null string for an element (which is invalid). If you want
to line up your matrix visually, use leading and trailing
zeroes in the floating point numbers to do it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no way
to put comments in the file. There is no signature or any
other metadata in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
you use the <b>-normalize</b> option, the weights in the
matrix aren&rsquo;t actually what is in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PNM
File</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.49 (December 2009), this was the only way to specify a
convolution matrix. <b>pnmconvol</b> used this method in an
attempt to exploit the generic matrix processing
capabilities of Netpbm, but as the Netpbm formats
don&rsquo;t directly allow matrices with the kinds of
numbers you need in a convolution matrix, it is quite
cumbersome. In fact, there simply is no way to specify some
convolution matrices with a legal Netpbm image, so to make
it work, <b>pnmconvol</b> has to relax the Netpbm file
requirement that sample values be no greater than the
image&rsquo;s maxval. I.e. it isn&rsquo;t even a real PNM
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The way you
select this method of supplying the convolution matrix is to
<i>not</i> specify <b>-matrix</b> or <b>-matrixfile</b>.
When you do that, you must specify a second non-option
argument -- that is the name of the PNM file (or PNM
equivalent PAM file).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
ways <b>pnmconvol</b> interprets the PNM convolution matrix
image pixels as weights: with offsets, and without
offsets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The simpler of
the two is without offsets. That is what happens when you
specify the <b>-nooffset</b> option. In that case,
<b>pnmconvol</b> simply normalizes the sample values in the
PNM image by dividing by the maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
here is a sample convolution file that causes an output
pixel to be a simple average of its corresponding input
pixel and its 8 neighbors, resulting in a smoothed
image:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">P2 <br>
3 3 <br>
18 <br>
2 2 2 <br>
2 2 2 <br>
2 2 2</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Note that the
above text is an actual PGM file -- you can cut and paste
it. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with the plain PGM format,
see <b>the PGM format specification</b>(1)).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pnmconvol</b>
divides each of the sample values (2) by the maxval (18) so
the weight of each of the 9 input pixels gets is 1/9, which
is exactly what you want to keep the overall brightness of
the image the same. <b>pnmconvol</b> creates an output pixel
by multiplying the values of each of 9 pixels by 1/9 and
adding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that with
maxval 18, the range of possible values is 0 to 18. After
scaling, the range is 0 to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a normal
convolution, where you&rsquo;re neither adding nor
subtracting total value from the image, but merely moving it
around, you&rsquo;ll want to make sure that all the scaled
values in (each plane of) your convolution PNM add up to 1,
which means all the actual sample values add up to the
maxval. Alternatively, you can use the <b>-normalize</b>
option to scale the scaled values further to make them all
add up to 1 automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> specify <b>-nooffset</b>,
<b>pnmconvol</b> applies an offset, the purpose of which is
to allow you to indicate negative weights even though PNM
sample values are never negative. In this case,
<b>pnmconvol</b> subtracts half the maxval from each sample
and then normalizes by dividing by half the maxval. So to
get the same result as we did above with <b>-nooffset</b>,
the convolution matrix PNM image would have to look like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">P2 <br>
3 3 <br>
18 <br>
10 10 10 <br>
10 10 10 <br>
10 10 10</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To see how this
works, do the above-mentioned offset: 10 - 18/2 gives 1. The
normalization step divides by 18/2 = 9, which makes it 1/9 -
exactly what you want. The equivalent matrix for 5x5
smoothing would have maxval 50 and be filled with 26.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that with
maxval 18, the range of possible values is 0 to 18. After
offset, that&rsquo;s -9 to 9, and after normalizing, the
range is -1 to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The convolution
file will usually be a PGM, so that the same convolution
gets applied to each color component. However, if you want
to use a PPM and do a different convolution to different
colors, you can certainly do that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Other Forms
of Convolution <br>
pnmconvol</b> does only arithmetic, linear combination
convolution. There are other forms of convolution that are
especially useful in image processing.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pgmmedian</b>
does median filtering, which is a form of convolution where
the output pixel value, rather than being a linear
combination of the pixels in the window, is the median of a
certain subset of them.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pgmmorphconv</b>
does dilation and erosion, which is like the median filter
but the output value is the minimum or maximum of the values
in the window.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably <b>-quiet</b>, see
<a href="index.html#commonoptions"> Common Options</a> ),
<b>pnmconvol</b> recognizes the following command line
options: <b><br>
-matrix=</b><i>convolution_matrix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The value of the convolution
matrix. See <a href="#matrixopt">Convolution Matrix</a>
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">You may not
specify both this and <b>-matrixfile</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option was
new in Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009). Before that, use a PNM
file for the convolution matrix.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-matrixfile=</b><i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This specifies that you are
supplying the convolution matrix in a file and names that
file. See <a href="#matrixfile">Convolution Matrix</a> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">You may not
specify both this and <b>-matrix</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option was
new in Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009). Before that, use a PNM
file for the convolution matrix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-normalize</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option says to adjust the
weights in your convolution matrix so they all add up to
one. You usually want them to add up to one so that the
convolved result tends to have the same overall brightness
as the input. With <b>-normalize</b>, <b>pnmconvol</b>
scales all the weights by the same factor to make the sum
one. It does this for each plane.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
quite convenient because you can just throw numbers into the
matrix that have roughly the right relationship to each
other and let <b>pnmconvol</b> do the work of normalizing
them. And you can adjust a matrix by raising or lowering
certain weights without having to modify all the other
weights to maintain normalcy. And you can use friendly
integers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">$ pnmconvol
myimage.ppm -normalize -matrix=1,1,1;1,1,1;1,1,1</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This is of
course a basic 3x3 average, but without you having to
specify 1/9 (.1111111) for each weight.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option was
new in Netpbm 10.50 (March 2010). But before Netpbm 10.79
(June 2017), it has no effect when you specify the
convolution matrix via pseudo-PNM file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-bias=</b><i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This specifies
an amount to add to the convolved value for each sample.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The purpose of
this addition is normally to handle negative convolution
results. Because the convolution matrix can contain negative
numbers, the convolved value for a pixel could be negative.
But Netpbm formats cannot contain negative sample values, so
without any bias, such samples would get clipped to zero.
The bias allows the output image to retain the information,
and a program that pocesses that output, knowing the bias
value, could reconstruct the real convolved values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
with <b>bias=100</b>, a sample whose convolved value is -5
appears as 95 in the output, whereas a sample whose
convolved value is 5 appears as 105 in the output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A typical value
for the bias is half the maxval, allowing the same range on
either side of zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the sample
value, after adding the bias, is still less than zero,
<b>pnmconvol</b> clips it to zero. If it exceeds the maxval
of the output image, it clips it to the maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default is
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option was
new in Netpbm 10.68 (September 2014).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-nooffset=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is part of the obsolete
PNM image method of specifying the convolution matrix. See
<a href="#matrixpnm">Convolution Matrix</a> .</p>

<h2>HISTORY
<a name="HISTORY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-nooffset</b> option was new in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004),
making it substantially easier to specify a convolution
matrix, but still hard. In Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009), the
PNM convolution matrix tyranny was finally ended with the
<b>-matrix</b> and <b>-matrixfile</b> options. In between,
<b>pnmconvol</b> was broken for a while because the Netpbm
library started enforcing the requirement that a sample
value not exceed the maxval of the image. <b>pnmconvol</b>
used the Netpbm library to read the PNM convolution matrix
file, but in the pseudo-PNM format that <b>pnmconvol</b>
uses, a sample value sometimes has to exceed the maxval.</p>
