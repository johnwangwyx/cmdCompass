<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">find - search
for files in a directory hierarchy</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>find</b>
[-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...]
[expression]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page documents the GNU version of <b>find</b>. GNU
<b>find</b> searches the directory tree rooted at each given
starting-point by evaluating the given expression from left
to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section
OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side
is false for <i>and</i> operations, true for <i>or</i>), at
which point <b>find</b> moves on to the next file name. If
no starting-point is specified, &rsquo;.&rsquo; is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
using <b>find</b> in an environment where security is
important (for example if you are using it to search
directories that are writable by other users), you should
read the &rsquo;Security Considerations&rsquo; chapter of
the findutils documentation, which is called <b>Finding
Files</b> and comes with findutils. That document also
includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual
page, so you may find it a more useful source of
information.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>-H</b>,
<b>-L</b> and <b>-P</b> options control the treatment of
symbolic links. Command-line arguments following these are
taken to be names of files or directories to be examined, up
to the first argument that begins with &rsquo;-&rsquo;, or
the argument &rsquo;(&rsquo; or &rsquo;!&rsquo;. That
argument and any following arguments are taken to be the
expression describing what is to be searched for. If no
paths are given, the current directory is used. If no
expression is given, the expression <b>-print</b> is used
(but you should probably consider using <b>-print0</b>
instead, anyway).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page talks about &rsquo;options&rsquo; within the expression
list. These options control the behaviour of <b>find</b> but
are specified immediately after the last path name. The five
&rsquo;real&rsquo; options <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-P</b>,
<b>-D</b> and <b>-O</b> must appear before the first path
name, if at all. A double dash <b>--</b> could theoretically
be used to signal that any remaining arguments are not
options, but this does not really work due to the way
<b>find</b> determines the end of the following path
arguments: it does that by reading until an expression
argument comes (which also starts with a &rsquo;-&rsquo;).
Now, if a path argument would start with a &rsquo;-&rsquo;,
then <b>find</b> would treat it as expression argument
instead. Thus, to ensure that all start points are taken as
such, and especially to prevent that wildcard patterns
expanded by the calling shell are not mistakenly treated as
expression arguments, it is generally safer to prefix
wildcards or dubious path names with either &rsquo;./&rsquo;
or to use absolute path names starting with &rsquo;/&rsquo;.
Alternatively, it is generally safe though non-portable to
use the GNU option <b>-files0-from</b> to pass arbitrary
starting points to <b>find</b>.</p>

<p>-P</p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Never follow symbolic links. This is the default
behaviour. When <b>find</b> examines or prints information
about files, and the file is a symbolic link, the
information used shall be taken from the properties of the
symbolic link itself.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>-L</p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Follow symbolic links. When <b>find</b> examines or
prints information about files, the information used shall
be taken from the properties of the file to which the link
points, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken
symbolic link or <b>find</b> is unable to examine the file
to which the link points). Use of this option implies
<b>-noleaf</b>. If you later use the <b>-P</b> option,
<b>-noleaf</b> will still be in effect. If <b>-L</b> is in
effect and <b>find</b> discovers a symbolic link to a
subdirectory during its search, the subdirectory pointed to
by the symbolic link will be searched.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>-L</b> option is in effect, the <b>-type</b> predicate
will always match against the type of the file that a
symbolic link points to rather than the link itself (unless
the symbolic link is broken). Actions that can cause
symbolic links to become broken while <b>find</b> is
executing (for example <b>-delete</b>) can give rise to
confusing behaviour. Using <b>-L</b> causes the
<b>-lname</b> and <b>-ilname</b> predicates always to return
false.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">-H</p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not follow symbolic links,
except while processing the command line arguments. When
<b>find</b> examines or prints information about files, the
information used shall be taken from the properties of the
symbolic link itself. The only exception to this behaviour
is when a file specified on the command line is a symbolic
link, and the link can be resolved. For that situation, the
information used is taken from whatever the link points to
(that is, the link is followed). The information about the
link itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by
the symbolic link cannot be examined. If <b>-H</b> is in
effect and one of the paths specified on the command line is
a symbolic link to a directory, the contents of that
directory will be examined (though of course
<b>-maxdepth&nbsp;0</b> would prevent this).</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If more than
one of <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b> and <b>-P</b> is specified, each
overrides the others; the last one appearing on the command
line takes effect. Since it is the default, the <b>-P</b>
option should be considered to be in effect unless either
<b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GNU <b>find</b>
frequently stats files during the processing of the command
line itself, before any searching has begun. These options
also affect how those arguments are processed. Specifically,
there are a number of tests that compare files listed on the
command line against a file we are currently considering. In
each case, the file specified on the command line will have
been examined and some of its properties will have been
saved. If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the
<b>-P</b> option is in effect (or if neither <b>-H</b> nor
<b>-L</b> were specified), the information used for the
comparison will be taken from the properties of the symbolic
link. Otherwise, it will be taken from the properties of the
file the link points to. If <b>find</b> cannot follow the
link (for example because it has insufficient privileges or
the link points to a nonexistent file) the properties of the
link itself will be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> options are in effect, any symbolic
links listed as the argument of <b>-newer</b> will be
dereferenced, and the timestamp will be taken from the file
to which the symbolic link points. The same consideration
applies to <b>-newerXY</b>, <b>-anewer</b> and
<b>-cnewer</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-follow</b> option has a similar effect to <b>-L</b>,
though it takes effect at the point where it appears (that
is, if <b>-L</b> is not used but <b>-follow</b> is, any
symbolic links appearing after <b>-follow</b> on the command
line will be dereferenced, and those before it will not).
<br>
-D debugopts</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print diagnostic information;
this can be helpful to diagnose problems with why
<b>find</b> is not doing what you want. The list of debug
options should be comma separated. Compatibility of the
debug options is not guaranteed between releases of
findutils. For a complete list of valid debug options, see
the output of <b>find -D&nbsp;help</b>. Valid debug options

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-Olevel</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enables query optimisation. The
<b>find</b> program reorders tests to speed up execution
while preserving the overall effect; that is, predicates
with side effects are not reordered relative to each other.
The optimisations performed at each optimisation level are
as follows.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>1</p></td>
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>This is the default optimisation level and corresponds
to the traditional behaviour. Expressions are reordered so
that tests based only on the names of files (for example
<b>-name</b> and <b>-regex</b>) are performed first.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>2</p></td>
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>Any <b>-type</b> or <b>-xtype</b> tests are performed
after any tests based only on the names of files, but before
any tests that require information from the inode. On many
modern versions of Unix, file types are returned by
<b>readdir()</b> and so these predicates are faster to
evaluate than predicates which need to stat the file first.
If you use the <b>-fstype&nbsp;</b><i>FOO</i> predicate and
specify a filesystem type <i>FOO</i> which is not known
(that is, present in &rsquo;/etc/mtab&rsquo;) at the time
<b>find</b> starts, that predicate is equivalent to
<b>-false</b>.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>3</p></td>
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="68%">


<p>At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query
optimiser is enabled. The order of tests is modified so that
cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more
expensive ones are performed later, if necessary. Within
each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later
according to whether they are likely to succeed or not. For
<b>-o</b>, predicates which are likely to succeed are
evaluated earlier, and for <b>-a</b>, predicates which are
likely to fail are evaluated earlier.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The cost-based
optimiser has a fixed idea of how likely any given test is
to succeed. In some cases the probability takes account of
the specific nature of the test (for example,
<b>-type&nbsp;f</b> is assumed to be more likely to succeed
than <b>-type&nbsp;c</b>). The cost-based optimiser is
currently being evaluated. If it does not actually improve
the performance of <b>find</b>, it will be removed again.
Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, robust
and effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels
over time. However, the default behaviour (i.e. optimisation
level 1) will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.
The findutils test suite runs all the tests on <b>find</b>
at each optimisation level and ensures that the result is
the same.</p>

<h2>EXPRESSION
<a name="EXPRESSION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The part of the
command line after the list of starting points is the
<i>expression</i>. This is a kind of query specification
describing how we match files and what we do with the files
that were matched. An expression is composed of a sequence
of things:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tests</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Tests return a true or false
value, usually on the basis of some property of a file we
are considering. The <b>-empty</b> test for example is true
only when the current file is empty.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Actions</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Actions have side effects (such
as printing something on the standard output) and return
either true or false, usually based on whether or not they
are successful. The <b>-print</b> action for example prints
the name of the current file on the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Global options</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Global options affect the
operation of tests and actions specified on any part of the
command line. Global options always return true. The
<b>-depth</b> option for example makes <b>find</b> traverse
the file system in a depth-first order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Positional options</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Positional options affect only
tests or actions which follow them. Positional options
always return true. The <b>-regextype</b> option for example
is positional, specifying the regular expression dialect for
regular expressions occurring later on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Operators</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Operators join together the
other items within the expression. They include for example
<b>-o</b> (meaning logical OR) and <b>-a</b> (meaning
logical AND). Where an operator is missing, <b>-a</b> is
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-print</b> action is performed on all files for which the
whole expression is true, unless it contains an action other
than <b>-prune</b> or <b>-quit</b>. Actions which inhibit
the default <b>-print</b> are <b>-delete</b>, <b>-exec</b>,
<b>-execdir</b>, <b>-ok</b>, <b>-okdir</b>, <b>-fls</b>,
<b>-fprint</b>, <b>-fprintf</b>, <b>-ls</b>, <b>-print</b>
and <b>-printf</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-delete</b> action also acts like an option (since it
implies <b>-depth</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>POSITIONAL
OPTIONS</b> <br>
Positional options always return true. They affect only
tests occurring later on the command line. <br>
-daystart</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Measure times (for
<b>-amin</b>, <b>-atime</b>, <b>-cmin</b>, <b>-ctime</b>,
<b>-mmin</b>, and <b>-mtime</b>) from the beginning of today
rather than from 24 hours ago. This option only affects
tests which appear later on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-follow</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Deprecated; use the <b>-L</b>
option instead. Dereference symbolic links. Implies
<b>-noleaf</b>. The <b>-follow</b> option affects only those
tests which appear after it on the command line. Unless the
<b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> option has been specified, the
position of the <b>-follow</b> option changes the behaviour
of the <b>-newer</b> predicate; any files listed as the
argument of <b>-newer</b> will be dereferenced if they are
symbolic links. The same consideration applies to
<b>-newerXY</b>, <b>-anewer</b> and <b>-cnewer</b>.
Similarly, the <b>-type</b> predicate will always match
against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to
rather than the link itself. Using <b>-follow</b> causes the
<b>-lname and -ilname</b> predicates always to return
false.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-regextype <i>type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Changes the regular expression
syntax understood by <b>-regex</b> and <b>-iregex</b> tests
which occur later on the command line. To see which regular
expression types are known, use <b>-regextype&nbsp;help</b>.
The Texinfo documentation (see <b>SEE ALSO</b>) explains the
meaning of and differences between the various types of
regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-warn, -nowarn</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Turn warning messages on or
off. These warnings apply only to the command line usage,
not to any conditions that <b>find</b> might encounter when
it searches directories. The default behaviour corresponds
to <b>-warn</b> if standard input is a tty, and to
<b>-nowarn</b> otherwise. If a warning message relating to
command-line usage is produced, the exit status of
<b>find</b> is not affected. If the <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>
environment variable is set, and <b>-warn</b> is also used,
it is not specified which, if any, warnings will be
active.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GLOBAL
OPTIONS</b> <br>
Global options always return true. Global options take
effect even for tests which occur earlier on the command
line. To prevent confusion, global options should specified
on the command-line after the list of start points, just
before the first test, positional option or action. If you
specify a global option in some other place, <b>find</b>
will issue a warning message explaining that this can be
confusing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The global
options occur after the list of start points, and so are not
the same kind of option as <b>-L</b>, for example.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-files0-from <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read the starting points from
<i>file</i> instead of getting them on the command line. In
contrast to the known limitations of passing starting points
via arguments on the command line, namely the limitation of
the amount of file names, and the inherent ambiguity of file
names clashing with option names, using this option allows
to safely pass an arbitrary number of starting points to
<b>find</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Using this
option and passing starting points on the command line is
mutually exclusive, and is therefore not allowed at the same
time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>file</i>
argument is mandatory. One can use
<b>-files0-from&nbsp;-</b> to read the list of starting
points from the <i>standard input</i> stream, and e.g. from
a pipe. In this case, the actions <b>-ok</b> and
<b>-okdir</b> are not allowed, because they would obviously
interfere with reading from <i>standard input</i> in order
to get a user confirmation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The starting
points in <i>file</i> have to be separated by ASCII NUL
characters. Two consecutive NUL characters, i.e., a starting
point with a Zero-length file name is not allowed and will
lead to an error diagnostic followed by a non-Zero exit code
later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In the case the
given <i>file</i> is empty, <b>find</b> does not process any
starting point and therefore will exit immediately after
parsing the program arguments. This is unlike the standard
invocation where <b>find</b> assumes the current directory
as starting point if no path argument is passed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The processing
of the starting points is otherwise as usual, e.g.
<b>find</b> will recurse into subdirectories unless
otherwise prevented. To process only the starting points,
one can additionally pass <b>-maxdepth&nbsp;0</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Further notes:
if a file is listed more than once in the input file, it is
unspecified whether it is visited more than once. If the
<i>file</i> is mutated during the operation of <b>find</b>,
the result is unspecified as well. Finally, the seek
position within the named <i>file</i> at the time
<b>find</b> exits, be it with <b>-quit</b> or in any other
way, is also unspecified. By &quot;unspecified&quot; here is
meant that it may or may not work or do any specific thing,
and that the behavior may change from platform to platform,
or from <b>findutils</b> release to release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-help, --help</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print a summary of the
command-line usage of <b>find</b> and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-ignore_readdir_race</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Normally, <b>find</b> will emit
an error message when it fails to stat a file. If you give
this option and a file is deleted between the time
<b>find</b> reads the name of the file from the directory
and the time it tries to stat the file, no error message
will be issued. This also applies to files or directories
whose names are given on the command line. This option takes
effect at the time the command line is read, which means
that you cannot search one part of the filesystem with this
option on and part of it with this option off (if you need
to do that, you will need to issue two <b>find</b> commands
instead, one with the option and one without it).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Furthermore,
<b>find</b> with the <b>-ignore_readdir_race</b> option will
ignore errors of the <b>-delete</b> action in the case the
file has disappeared since the parent directory was read: it
will not output an error diagnostic, and the return code of
the <b>-delete</b> action will be true.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-maxdepth <i>levels</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Descend at most <i>levels</i>
(a non-negative integer) levels of directories below the
starting-points. Using <b>-maxdepth&nbsp;0</b> means only
apply the tests and actions to the starting-points
themselves.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-mindepth <i>levels</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not apply any tests or
actions at levels less than <i>levels</i> (a non-negative
integer). Using <b>-mindepth&nbsp;1</b> means process all
files except the starting-points.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not optimize by assuming

filesystems that do not follow the Unix directory-link
convention, such as CD-ROM or MS-DOS filesystems or AFS
volume mount points. Each directory on a normal Unix
filesystem has at least 2 hard links: its name and its
&rsquo;.&rsquo; entry. Additionally, its subdirectories (if
any) each have a &rsquo;..&rsquo; entry linked to that
directory. When <b>find</b> is examining a directory, after
it has statted 2 fewer subdirectories than the

(&rsquo;leaf&rsquo; files in the directory tree). If only

rounding affects the interpretation of file modification
times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-name <i>pattern</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Base of file name (the path
with the leading directories removed) matches shell pattern
<i>pattern</i>. Because the leading directories are removed,
the file names considered for a match with <b>-name</b> will
never include a slash, so &rsquo;-name a/b&rsquo; will never
match anything (you probably need to use <b>-path</b>
instead). A warning is issued if you try to do this, unless
the environment variable <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> is set. The
metacharacters (&rsquo;*&rsquo;, &rsquo;?&rsquo;, and
&rsquo;[]&rsquo;) match a &rsquo;.&rsquo; at the start of
the base name (this is a change in findutils-4.2.2; see
section STANDARDS CONFORMANCE below). To ignore a directory
and the files under it, use <b>-prune</b> rather than
checking every file in the tree; see an example in the
description of that action. Braces are not recognised as
being special, despite the fact that some shells including
Bash imbue braces with a special meaning in shell patterns.
The filename matching is performed with the use of the
<b>fnmatch</b>(3) library function. Don&rsquo;t forget to
enclose the pattern in quotes in order to protect it from
expansion by the shell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-newer <i>reference</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Time of the last data
modification of the current file is more recent than that of
the last data modification of the <i>reference</i> file. If
<i>reference</i> is a symbolic link and the <b>-H</b> option
or the <b>-L</b> option is in effect, then the time of the

used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-newerXY <i>reference</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Succeeds if timestamp <i>X</i>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Some
combinations are invalid; for example, it is invalid for
<i>X</i> to be <i>t</i>. Some combinations are not
implemented on all systems; for example <i>B</i> is not
supported on all systems. If an invalid or unsupported
combination of <i>XY</i> is specified, a fatal error
results. Time specifications are interpreted as for the
argument to the <b>-d</b> option of GNU <b>date</b>. If you
try to use the birth time of a reference file, and the birth
time cannot be determined, a fatal error message results. If
you specify a test which refers to the birth time of files
being examined, this test will fail for any files where the
birth time is unknown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-nogroup</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">No user corresponds to
file&rsquo;s numeric user ID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-path <i>pattern</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">File name matches shell pattern
<i>pattern</i>. The metacharacters do not treat
&rsquo;/&rsquo; or &rsquo;.&rsquo; specially; so, for
example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%;">find . -path
&quot;./sr*sc&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">will print an entry for a
directory called <i>./src/misc</i> (if one exists). To
ignore a whole directory tree, use <b>-prune</b> rather than
checking every file in the tree. Note that the pattern match
test applies to the whole file name, starting from one of
the start points named on the command line. It would only
make sense to use an absolute path name here if the relevant
start point is also an absolute path. This means that this
command will never match anything:</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%;">find bar -path /foo/bar/myfile
-print</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Find compares the <b>-path</b>
argument with the concatenation of a directory name and the
base name of the file it&rsquo;s examining. Since the
concatenation will never end with a slash, <b>-path</b>
arguments ending in a slash will match nothing (except
perhaps a start point specified on the command line). The
predicate <b>-path</b> is also supported by HP-UX
<b>find</b> and is part of the POSIX 2008 standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-perm <i>mode</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">File&rsquo;s permission bits
are exactly <i>mode</i> (octal or symbolic). Since an exact
match is required, if you want to use this form for symbolic
modes, you may have to specify a rather complex mode string.
For example &rsquo;-perm g=w&rsquo; will only match files
which have mode 0020 (that is, ones for which group write
permission is the only permission set). It is more likely
that you will want to use the &rsquo;/&rsquo; or
&rsquo;-&rsquo; forms, for example &rsquo;-perm -g=w&rsquo;,
which matches any file with group write permission. See the
<b>EXAMPLES</b> section for some illustrative examples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-perm -<i>mode</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">All of the permission bits
<i>mode</i> are set for the file. Symbolic modes are
accepted in this form, and this is usually the way in which
you would want to use them. You must specify
&rsquo;u&rsquo;, &rsquo;g&rsquo; or &rsquo;o&rsquo; if you
use a symbolic mode. See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section for
some illustrative examples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-perm /<i>mode</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Any of the permission bits
<i>mode</i> are set for the file. Symbolic modes are
accepted in this form. You must specify &rsquo;u&rsquo;,
&rsquo;g&rsquo; or &rsquo;o&rsquo; if you use a symbolic
mode. See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section for some illustrative
examples. If no permission bits in <i>mode</i> are set, this
test matches any file (the idea here is to be consistent
with the behaviour of <b>-perm&nbsp;-000</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-perm +<i>mode</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is no longer supported
(and has been deprecated since 2005). Use <b>-perm
/</b><i>mode</i> instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-readable</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Matches files which are
readable by the current user. This takes into account access
control lists and other permissions artefacts which the
<b>-perm</b> test ignores. This test makes use of the
<b>access</b>(2) system call, and so can be fooled by NFS
servers which do UID mapping (or root-squashing), since many
systems implement <b>access</b>(2) in the client&rsquo;s
kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping information
held on the server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-regex <i>pattern</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">File name matches regular
expression <i>pattern</i>. This is a match on the whole
path, not a search. For example, to match a file named
<i>./fubar3,</i> you can use the regular expression
&rsquo;.*bar.&rsquo; or &rsquo;.*b.*3&rsquo;, but not
&rsquo;f.*r3&rsquo;. The regular expressions understood by
<b>find</b> are by default Emacs Regular Expressions (except
that &rsquo;.&rsquo; matches newline), but this can be
changed with the <b>-regextype</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-samefile <i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">File refers to the same inode
as <i>name</i>. When <b>-L</b> is in effect, this can
include symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-size <i>n</i>[cwbkMG]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">File uses less than, more than

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ACTIONS</b>
<br>
-delete</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Delete files or directories;
true if removal succeeded. If the removal failed, an error
message is issued and <b>find</b>&rsquo;s exit status will
be nonzero (when it eventually exits).</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Warning</b>:
Don&rsquo;t forget that <b>find</b> evaluates the command
line as an expression, so putting <b>-delete</b> first will
make <b>find</b> try to delete everything below the starting
points you specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The use of the
<b>-delete</b> action on the command line automatically
turns on the <b>-depth</b> option. As in turn <b>-depth</b>
makes <b>-prune</b> ineffective, the <b>-delete</b> action
cannot usefully be combined with <b>-prune</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Often, the user
might want to test a find command line with <b>-print</b>
prior to adding <b>-delete</b> for the actual removal run.
To avoid surprising results, it is usually best to remember
to use <b>-depth</b> explicitly during those earlier test
runs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-delete</b> action will fail to remove a directory unless
it is empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Together with
the <b>-ignore_readdir_race</b> option, <b>find</b> will
ignore errors of the <b>-delete</b> action in the case the
file has disappeared since the parent directory was read: it
will not output an error diagnostic, not change the exit
code to nonzero, and the return code of the <b>-delete</b>
action will be true.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-exec <i>command</i> ;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Execute <i>command</i>; true if
0 status is returned. All following arguments to <b>find</b>
are taken to be arguments to the command until an argument
consisting of &rsquo;;&rsquo; is encountered. The string
&rsquo;{}&rsquo; is replaced by the current file name being
processed everywhere it occurs in the arguments to the
command, not just in arguments where it is alone, as in some
versions of <b>find</b>. Both of these constructions might
need to be escaped (with a &rsquo;\&rsquo;) or quoted to
protect them from expansion by the shell. See the
<b>EXAMPLES</b> section for examples of the use of the
<b>-exec</b> option. The specified command is run once for
each matched file. The command is executed in the starting
directory. There are unavoidable security problems
surrounding use of the <b>-exec</b> action; you should use
the <b>-execdir</b> option instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-exec <i>command</i> {} +</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This variant of the
<b>-exec</b> action runs the specified command on the
selected files, but the command line is built by appending
each selected file name at the end; the total number of
invocations of the command will be much less than the number
of matched files. The command line is built in much the same
way that <b>xargs</b> builds its command lines. Only one
instance of &rsquo;{}&rsquo; is allowed within the command,
and it must appear at the end, immediately before the
&rsquo;+&rsquo;; it needs to be escaped (with a
&rsquo;\&rsquo;) or quoted to protect it from interpretation
by the shell. The command is executed in the starting
directory. If any invocation with the &rsquo;+&rsquo; form
returns a non-zero value as exit status, then <b>find</b>
returns a non-zero exit status. If <b>find</b> encounters an
error, this can sometimes cause an immediate exit, so some
pending commands may not be run at all. For this reason
<b>-exec&nbsp;</b><i>my-command&nbsp;</i><b>...&nbsp;{}&nbsp;+&nbsp;-quit</b>
may not result in <i>my-command</i> actually being run. This
variant of <b>-exec</b> always returns true.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-execdir <i>command</i> ; <br>
-execdir <i>command</i> {} +</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Like <b>-exec</b>, but the
specified command is run from the subdirectory containing
the matched file, which is not normally the directory in
which you started <b>find</b>. As with -exec, the {} should
be quoted if find is being invoked from a shell. This a much
more secure method for invoking commands, as it avoids race
conditions during resolution of the paths to the matched
files. As with the <b>-exec</b> action, the &rsquo;+&rsquo;
form of <b>-execdir</b> will build a command line to process
more than one matched file, but any given invocation of
<i>command</i> will only list files that exist in the same
subdirectory. If you use this option, you must ensure that
your <b>PATH</b> environment variable does not reference
&rsquo;.&rsquo;; otherwise, an attacker can run any commands
they like by leaving an appropriately-named file in a
directory in which you will run <b>-execdir</b>. The same
applies to having entries in <b>PATH</b> which are empty or
which are not absolute directory names. If any invocation
with the &rsquo;+&rsquo; form returns a non-zero value as
exit status, then <b>find</b> returns a non-zero exit
status. If <b>find</b> encounters an error, this can
sometimes cause an immediate exit, so some pending commands
may not be run at all. The result of the action depends on
whether the <b>+</b> or the <b>;</b> variant is being used;
<b>-execdir&nbsp;</b><i>command&nbsp;</i><b>{}&nbsp;+</b>
always returns true, while
<b>-execdir&nbsp;</b><i>command&nbsp;</i><b>{}&nbsp;;</b>
returns true only if <i>command</i> returns 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-fls <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">True; like <b>-ls</b> but write
to <i>file</i> like <b>-fprint</b>. The output file is
always created, even if the predicate is never matched. See
the <b>UNUSUAL FILENAMES</b> section for information about
how unusual characters in filenames are handled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-fprint <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">True; print the full file name
into file <i>file</i>. If <i>file</i> does not exist when
<b>find</b> is run, it is created; if it does exist, it is
truncated. The file names <i>/dev/stdout</i> and
<i>/dev/stderr</i> are handled specially; they refer to the
standard output and standard error output, respectively. The
output file is always created, even if the predicate is
never matched. See the <b>UNUSUAL FILENAMES</b> section for
information about how unusual characters in filenames are
handled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-fprint0 <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The response to

can be specified as with the <b>printf</b>(3) C function.
Please note that many of the fields are printed as %s rather
than %d, and this may mean that flags don&rsquo;t work as
you might expect. This also means that the &rsquo;-&rsquo;
flag does work (it forces fields to be left-aligned). Unlike
<b>-print</b>, <b>-printf</b> does not add a newline at the
end of the string. The escapes and directives are:</p>

<h2>UNUSUAL FILENAMES
<a name="UNUSUAL FILENAMES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many of the
actions of <b>find</b> result in the printing of data which
is under the control of other users. This includes file
names, sizes, modification times and so forth. File names
are a potential problem since they can contain any character
except &rsquo;\0&rsquo; and &rsquo;/&rsquo;. Unusual
characters in file names can do unexpected and often
undesirable things to your terminal (for example, changing
the settings of your function keys on some terminals).
Unusual characters are handled differently by various
actions, as described below. <br>
-print0, -fprint0</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Always print the exact
filename, unchanged, even if the output is going to a
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-ls, -fls</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Unusual characters are always
escaped. White space, backslash, and double quote characters
are printed using C-style escaping (for example
&rsquo;\f&rsquo;, &rsquo;\&quot;&rsquo;). Other unusual
characters are printed using an octal escape. Other
printable characters (for <b>-ls</b> and <b>-fls</b> these
are the characters between octal 041 and 0176) are printed
as-is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-printf, -fprintf</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If the output is not going to a
terminal, it is printed as-is. Otherwise, the result depends
on which directive is in use. The directives %D, %F, %g, %G,
%H, %Y, and %y expand to values which are not under control
of files&rsquo; owners, and so are printed as-is. The
directives %a, %b, %c, %d, %i, %k, %m, %M, %n, %s, %t, %u
and %U have values which are under the control of
files&rsquo; owners but which cannot be used to send
arbitrary data to the terminal, and so these are printed
as-is. The directives %f, %h, %l, %p and %P are quoted. This
quoting is performed in the same way as for GNU <b>ls</b>.
This is not the same quoting mechanism as the one used for
<b>-ls</b> and <b>-fls</b>. If you are able to decide what
format to use for the output of <b>find</b> then it is
normally better to use &rsquo;\0&rsquo; as a terminator than
to use newline, as file names can contain white space and
newline characters. The setting of the <b>LC_CTYPE</b>
environment variable is used to determine which characters
need to be quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-print, -fprint</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Quoting is handled in the same
way as for <b>-printf</b> and <b>-fprintf</b>. If you are
using <b>find</b> in a script or in a situation where the
matched files might have arbitrary names, you should
consider using <b>-print0</b> instead of <b>-print</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>-ok</b>
and <b>-okdir</b> actions print the current filename as-is.

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All other
options, predicates, expressions and so forth are extensions
beyond the POSIX standard. Many of these extensions are not
unique to GNU find, however.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The POSIX
standard requires that <b>find</b> detects loops:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>find</b>
utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a
previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last
file encountered. When it detects an infinite loop, find
shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and shall
either recover its position in the hierarchy or
terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GNU <b>find</b>
complies with these requirements. The link count of
directories which contain entries which are hard links to an
ancestor will often be lower than they otherwise should be.
This can mean that GNU find will sometimes optimise away the
visiting of a subdirectory which is actually a link to an
ancestor. Since <b>find</b> does not actually enter such a
subdirectory, it is allowed to avoid emitting a diagnostic
message. Although this behaviour may be somewhat confusing,
it is unlikely that anybody actually depends on this
behaviour. If the leaf optimisation has been turned off with
<b>-noleaf</b>, the directory entry will always be examined
and the diagnostic message will be issued where it is
appropriate. Symbolic links cannot be used to create
filesystem cycles as such, but if the <b>-L</b> option or
the <b>-follow</b> option is in use, a diagnostic message is
issued when <b>find</b> encounters a loop of symbolic links.
As with loops containing hard links, the leaf optimisation
will often mean that <b>find</b> knows that it doesn&rsquo;t
need to call <i>stat()</i> or <i>chdir()</i> on the symbolic
link, so this diagnostic is frequently not necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>-d</b>
option is supported for compatibility with various BSD
systems, but you should use the POSIX-compliant option
<b>-depth</b> instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b> environment variable does not affect
the behaviour of the <b>-regex</b> or <b>-iregex</b> tests
because those tests aren&rsquo;t specified in the POSIX
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The POSIX standard specifies
that this variable affects the pattern matching to be used
for the <b>-name</b> option. GNU find uses the
<b>fnmatch</b>(3) library function, and so support for
<b>LC_COLLATE</b> depends on the system library. This
variable also affects the interpretation of the response to
<b>-ok</b>; while the <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> variable selects
the actual pattern used to interpret the response to
<b>-ok</b>, the interpretation of any bracket expressions in
the pattern will be affected by <b>LC_COLLATE</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">LC_CTYPE</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This variable affects the
treatment of character classes used in regular expressions

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Setting this

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The construct

<b>-prune</b> matches things which are to be pruned.
However, the <b>-prune</b> action itself returns true, so
the following <b>-o</b> ensures that the right hand side is
evaluated only for those directories which didn&rsquo;t get
pruned (the contents of the pruned directories are not even
visited, so their contents are irrelevant). The expression
on the right hand side of the <b>-o</b> is in parentheses
only for clarity. It emphasises that the <b>-print0</b>
action takes place only for things that didn&rsquo;t have
<b>-prune</b> applied to them. Because the default
&rsquo;and&rsquo; condition between tests binds more tightly
than <b>-o</b>, this is the default anyway, but the
parentheses help to show what is going on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax
<b>-perm +MODE</b> was removed in findutils-4.5.12, in
favour of <b>-perm /MODE</b>. The <b>+MODE</b> syntax had
been deprecated since findutils-4.2.21 which was released in
2005.</p>

<h2>NON-BUGS
<a name="NON-BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Operator
precedence surprises</b> <br>
The command <b>find . -name afile -o -name bfile -print</b>
will never print <i>afile</i> because this is actually
equivalent to <b>find . -name afile -o \( -name bfile -a
-print \)</b>. Remember that the precedence of <b>-a</b> is
higher than that of <b>-o</b> and when there is no operator
specified between tests, <b>-a</b> is assumed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&ldquo;paths
must precede expression&rdquo; error message <br>
$ find . -name *.c -print</b> <br>
find: paths must precede expression <br>
find: possible unquoted pattern after predicate
&rsquo;-name&rsquo;?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This happens
when the shell could expand the pattern <i>*.c</i> to more
than one file name existing in the current directory, and
passing the resulting file names in the command line to
<b>find</b> like this: <b><br>
find . -name frcode.c locate.c word_io.c -print</b> <br>
That command is of course not going to work, because the
<b>-name</b> predicate allows exactly only one pattern as
argument. Instead of doing things this way, you should
enclose the pattern in quotes or escape the wildcard, thus
allowing <b>find</b> to use the pattern with the wildcard
during the search for file name matching instead of file
names expanded by the parent shell: <b><br>
$ find . -name '*.c' -print <br>
$ find . -name \*.c -print</b></p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
security problems inherent in the behaviour that the POSIX
standard specifies for <b>find</b>, which therefore cannot
be fixed. For example, the <b>-exec</b> action is inherently
insecure, and <b>-execdir</b> should be used instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The environment
variable <b>LC_COLLATE</b> has no effect on the <b>-ok</b>
action.</p>
