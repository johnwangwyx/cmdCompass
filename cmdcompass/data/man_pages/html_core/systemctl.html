</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemctl</b>
may be used to introspect and control the state of the
&quot;systemd&quot; system and service manager. Please refer
to <b>systemd</b>(1) for an introduction into the basic
concepts and functionality this tool manages.</p>

<h2>COMMANDS
<a name="COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
commands are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unit
Commands (Introspection and Modification) <br>
list-units</b> [<i>PATTERN</i>...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List units that <b>systemd</b>
currently has in memory. This includes units that are either
referenced directly or through a dependency, units that are
pinned by applications programmatically, or units that were
active in the past and have failed. By default only units
which are active, have pending jobs, or have failed are
shown; this can be changed with option <b>--all</b>. If one
or more <i>PATTERN</i>s are specified, only units matching
one of them are shown. The units that are shown are
additionally filtered by <b>--type=</b> and <b>--state=</b>
if those options are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
command does not show unit templates, but only instances of
unit templates. Units templates that aren't instantiated are
not runnable, and will thus never show up in the output of
this command. Specifically this means that foo@.service will
never be shown in this list &mdash; unless instantiated,
e.g. as foo@bar.service. Use <b>list-unit-files</b> (see
below) for listing installed unit template files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Produces output
similar to</p>

ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e.
generalization of SUB. <br>
SUB = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on
unit type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">123 loaded

too. <br>
To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl

the last unit of a given type are underlined if the terminal
supports that. A colored dot is shown next to services which
were masked, not found, or otherwise failed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The LOAD column
shows the load state, one of <b>loaded</b>,

state, one of <b>active</b>, <b>reloading</b>,
<b>inactive</b>, <b>failed</b>, <b>activating</b>,
<b>deactivating</b>. The SUB column shows the
unit-type-specific detailed state of the unit, possible
values vary by unit type. The list of possible LOAD, ACTIVE,
and SUB states is not constant and new systemd releases may
both add and remove values.</p>

<b>--all</b> and <b>--state=</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>is-active</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Check whether any of the
specified units are active (i.e. running). Returns an exit
code <b>0</b> if at least one is active, or non-zero
otherwise. Unless <b>--quiet</b> is specified, this will
also print the current unit state to standard output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>is-failed</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Check whether any of the
specified units are in a &quot;failed&quot; state. Returns
an exit code <b>0</b> if at least one has failed, non-zero
otherwise. Unless <b>--quiet</b> is specified, this will
also print the current unit state to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>status</b>
[<i>PATTERN</i>...|<i>PID</i>...]]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show runtime status information
about the whole system or about one or more units followed
by most recent log data from the journal. If no positional
arguments are specified, and no unit filter is given with
<b>--type=</b>, <b>--state=</b>, or <b>--failed</b>, shows
the status of the whole system. If combined with
<b>--all</b>, follows that with the status of all units. If
positional arguments are specified, each positional argument
is treated as either a unit name to show, or a glob pattern
to show units whose names match that pattern, or a PID to
show the unit containing that PID. When <b>--type=</b>,
<b>--state=</b>, or <b>--failed</b> are used, units are
additionally filtered by the TYPE and ACTIVE state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This function
is intended to generate human-readable output. If you are
looking for computer-parsable output, use <b>show</b>
instead. By default, this function only shows 10 lines of
output and ellipsizes lines to fit in the terminal window.
This can be changed with <b>--lines</b> and <b>--full</b>,
see above. In addition, <b>journalctl --unit=</b><i>NAME</i>
or <b>journalctl --user-unit=</b><i>NAME</i> use a similar
filter for messages and might be more convenient.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
operation only displays <i>runtime</i> status, i.e.
information about the current invocation of the unit (if it
is running) or the most recent invocation (if it is not
running anymore, and has not been released from memory).
Information about earlier invocations, invocations from
previous system boots, or prior invocations that have
already been released from memory may be retrieved via
<b>journalctl --unit=</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">systemd
implicitly loads units as necessary, so just running the
<b>status</b> will attempt to load a file. The command is
thus not useful for determining if something was already
loaded or not. The units may possibly also be quickly
unloaded after the operation is completed if there's no
reason to keep it in memory thereafter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The dot
(&quot;&acirc;&quot;) uses color on supported terminals to
summarize the unit state at a glance. Along with its color,
its shape varies according to its state:
&quot;inactive&quot; or &quot;maintenance&quot; is a white
circle (&quot;&acirc;&quot;), &quot;active&quot; is a green
dot (&quot;&acirc;&quot;), &quot;deactivating&quot; is a
white dot, &quot;failed&quot; or &quot;error&quot; is a red
cross (&quot;&times;&quot;), and &quot;reloading&quot; is a
green clockwise circle arrow
(&quot;&acirc;&raquo;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;Loaded:&quot; line in the output will show
&quot;loaded&quot; if the unit has been loaded into memory.
Other possible values for &quot;Loaded:&quot; include:
&quot;error&quot; if there was a problem loading it,
&quot;not-found&quot; if no unit file was found for this
unit, &quot;bad-setting&quot; if an essential unit file
setting could not be parsed and &quot;masked&quot; if the
unit file has been masked. Along with showing the path to
the unit file, this line will also show the enablement
state. Enabled units are included in the dependency network
between units, and thus are started at boot or via some
other form of activation. See the full table of possible
enablement states &mdash; including the definition of
&quot;masked&quot; &mdash; in the documentation for the
<b>is-enabled</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;Active:&quot; line shows active state. The value is
usually &quot;active&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot;. Active
could mean started, bound, plugged in, etc depending on the
unit type. The unit could also be in process of changing
states, reporting a state of &quot;activating&quot; or
&quot;deactivating&quot;. A special &quot;failed&quot; state
is entered when the service failed in some way, such as a
crash, exiting with an error code or timing out. If the
failed state is entered the cause will be logged for later
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>show</b>
[<i>PATTERN</i>...|<i>JOB</i>...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show properties of one or more
units, jobs, or the manager itself. If no argument is
specified, properties of the manager will be shown. If a
unit name is specified, properties of the unit are shown,
and if a job ID is specified, properties of the job are
shown. By default, empty properties are suppressed. Use
<b>--all</b> to show those too. To select specific
properties to show, use <b>--property=</b>. This command is
intended to be used whenever computer-parsable output is
required. Use <b>status</b> if you are looking for formatted
human-readable output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Many properties
shown by <b>systemctl show</b> map directly to configuration
settings of the system and service manager and its unit
files. Note that the properties shown by the command are
generally more low-level, normalized versions of the
original configuration settings and expose runtime state in
addition to configuration. For example, properties shown for
service units include the service's current main process
identifier as &quot;MainPID&quot; (which is runtime state),
and time settings are always exposed as properties ending in
the &quot;...USec&quot; suffix even if a matching
configuration options end in &quot;...Sec&quot;, because
microseconds is the normalized time unit used internally by
the system and service manager.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For details
about many of these properties, see the documentation of the
D-Bus interface backing these properties, see
<b>org.freedesktop.systemd1</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cat</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show backing files of one or
more units. Prints the &quot;fragment&quot; and
&quot;drop-ins&quot; (source files) of units. Each file is
preceded by a comment which includes the file name. Note
that this shows the contents of the backing files on disk,
which may not match the system manager's understanding of
these units if any unit files were updated on disk and the
<b>daemon-reload</b> command wasn't issued since.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>help</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...|</b><i>PID</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show manual pages for one or
more units, if available. If a PID is given, the manual
pages for the unit the process belongs to are shown.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>list-dependencies</b>
[<i>UNIT</i>...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Shows units required and wanted
by the specified units. This recursively lists units
following the <i>Requires=</i>, <i>Requisite=</i>,
<i>ConsistsOf=</i>, <i>Wants=</i>, <i>BindsTo=</i>
dependencies. If no units are specified, default.target is
implied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
only target units are recursively expanded. When
<b>--all</b> is passed, all other units are recursively
expanded as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Options
<b>--reverse</b>, <b>--after</b>, <b>--before</b> may be
used to change what types of dependencies are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
command only lists units currently loaded into memory by the
service manager. In particular, this command is not suitable
to get a comprehensive list at all reverse dependencies on a
specific unit, as it won't list the dependencies declared by
units currently not loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>start</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Start (activate) one or more
units specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that unit
glob patterns expand to names of units currently in memory.
Units which are not active and are not in a failed state
usually are not in memory, and will not be matched by any
pattern. In addition, in case of instantiated units, systemd
is often unaware of the instance name until the instance has
been started. Therefore, using glob patterns with
<b>start</b> has limited usefulness. Also, secondary alias
names of units are not considered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>--all</b> may be used to also operate on inactive units
which are referenced by other loaded units. Note that this
is not the same as operating on &quot;all&quot; possible
units, because as the previous paragraph describes, such a
list is ill-defined. Nevertheless, <b>systemctl start
--all</b> <i>GLOB</i> may be useful if all the units that
should match the pattern are pulled in by some target which
is known to be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>stop</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stop (deactivate) one or more
units specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command
will fail if the unit does not exist or if stopping of the
unit is prohibited (see <i>RefuseManualStop=</i> in
<b>systemd.unit</b>(5)). It will <i>not</i> fail if any of
the commands configured to stop the unit (<i>ExecStop=</i>,
etc.) fail, because the manager will still forcibly
terminate the unit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>reload</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Asks all units listed on the
command line to reload their configuration. Note that this
will reload the service-specific configuration, not the unit
configuration file of systemd. If you want systemd to reload
the configuration file of a unit, use the
<b>daemon-reload</b> command. In other words: for the
example case of Apache, this will reload Apache's httpd.conf
in the web server, not the apache.service systemd unit
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command
should not be confused with the <b>daemon-reload</b>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>restart</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stop and then start one or more
units specified on the command line. If the units are not
running yet, they will be started.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
restarting a unit with this command does not necessarily
flush out all of the unit's resources before it is started
again. For example, the per-service file descriptor storage
facility (see <i>FileDescriptorStoreMax=</i> in
<b>systemd.service</b>(5)) will remain intact as long as the
unit has a job pending, and is only cleared when the unit is
fully stopped and no jobs are pending anymore. If it is
intended that the file descriptor store is flushed out, too,
during a restart operation an explicit <b>systemctl stop</b>
command followed by <b>systemctl start</b> should be
issued.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>try-restart</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stop and then start one or more
units specified on the command line if the units are
running. This does nothing if units are not running.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>reload-or-restart</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reload one or more units if
they support it. If not, stop and then start them instead.
If the units are not running yet, they will be started.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>try-reload-or-restart</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reload one or more units if
they support it. If not, stop and then start them instead.
This does nothing if the units are not running.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>isolate</b>
<i>UNIT</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Start the unit specified on the
command line and its dependencies and stop all others,
unless they have <b>IgnoreOnIsolate=yes</b> (see
<b>systemd.unit</b>(5)). If a unit name with no extension is
given, an extension of &quot;.target&quot; will be
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command is
dangerous, since it will immediately stop processes that are
not enabled in the new target, possibly including the
graphical environment or terminal you are currently
using.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
operation is allowed only on units where
<b>AllowIsolate=</b> is enabled. See <b>systemd.unit</b>(5)
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>kill</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Send a signal to one or more
processes of the unit. Use <b>--kill-whom=</b> to select
which process to kill. Use <b>--signal=</b> to select the
signal to send.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>clean</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Remove the configuration,
state, cache, logs or runtime data of the specified units.
Use <b>--what=</b> to select which kind of resource to
remove. For service units this may be used to remove the
directories configured with <i>ConfigurationDirectory=</i>,
<i>StateDirectory=</i>, <i>CacheDirectory=</i>,
<i>LogsDirectory=</i> and <i>RuntimeDirectory=</i>, see
<b>systemd.exec</b>(5) for details. For timer units this may
be used to clear out the persistent timestamp data if
<i>Persistent=</i> is used and <b>--what=state</b> is
selected, see <b>systemd.timer</b>(5). This command only
applies to units that use either of these settings. If
<b>--what=</b> is not specified, both the cache and runtime
data are removed (as these two types of data are generally
redundant and reproducible on the next invocation of the
unit).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>freeze</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Freeze one or more units
specified on the command line using cgroup freezer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Freezing the
unit will cause all processes contained within the cgroup
corresponding to the unit to be suspended. Being suspended
means that unit's processes won't be scheduled to run on CPU
until thawed. Note that this command is supported only on
systems that use unified cgroup hierarchy. Unit is
automatically thawed just before we execute a job against
the unit, e.g. before the unit is stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>thaw</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Thaw (unfreeze) one or more
units specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
inverse operation to the <b>freeze</b> command and resumes
the execution of processes in the unit's cgroup.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>set-property</b>
<i>UNIT PROPERTY</i><b>=</b><i>VALUE</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the specified unit
properties at runtime where this is supported. This allows
changing configuration parameter properties such as resource
control settings at runtime. Not all properties may be
changed at runtime, but many resource control settings
(primarily those in <b>systemd.resource-control</b>(5)) may.
The changes are applied immediately, and stored on disk for
future boots, unless <b>--runtime</b> is passed, in which
case the settings only apply until the next reboot. The
syntax of the property assignment follows closely the syntax
of assignments in unit files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
<b>systemctl set-property foobar.service
CPUWeight=200</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
specified unit appears to be inactive, the changes will be
only stored on disk as described previously hence they will
be effective when the unit will be started.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
command allows changing multiple properties at the same
time, which is preferable over setting them
individually.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
<b>systemctl set-property foobar.service CPUWeight=200
MemoryMax=2G IPAccounting=yes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Like with unit
file configuration settings, assigning an empty setting
usually resets a property to its defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>bind</b>
<i>UNIT PATH</i> [<i>PATH</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Bind-mounts a file or directory
from the host into the specified unit's mount namespace. The
first path argument is the source file or directory on the
host, the second path argument is the destination file or
directory in the unit's mount namespace. When the latter is
omitted, the destination path in the unit's mount namespace
is the same as the source path on the host. When combined
with the <b>--read-only</b> switch, a ready-only bind mount
is created. When combined with the <b>--mkdir</b> switch,
the destination path is first created before the mount is
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
option is currently only supported for units that run within
a mount namespace (e.g.: with <b>RootImage=</b>,
<b>PrivateMounts=</b>, etc.). This command supports
bind-mounting directories, regular files, device nodes,
<b>AF_UNIX</b> socket nodes, as well as FIFOs. The bind
mount is ephemeral, and it is undone as soon as the current
unit process exists. Note that the namespace mentioned here,
where the bind mount will be added to, is the one where the
main service process runs. Other processes (those exececuted
by <b>ExecReload=</b>, <b>ExecStartPre=</b>, etc.) run in
distinct namespaces.</p>

<i>UNIT IMAGE</i> [<i>PATH</i>
[<i>PARTITION_NAME</i>:<i>MOUNT_OPTIONS</i>]]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Mounts an image from the host
into the specified unit's mount namespace. The first path
argument is the source image on the host, the second path
argument is the destination directory in the unit's mount
namespace (i.e. inside
<b>RootImage=</b>/<b>RootDirectory=</b>). The following
argument, if any, is interpreted as a colon-separated tuple
of partition name and comma-separated list of mount options
for that partition. The format is the same as the service
<b>MountImages=</b> setting. When combined with the
<b>--read-only</b> switch, a ready-only mount is created.
When combined with the <b>--mkdir</b> switch, the
destination path is first created before the mount is
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
option is currently only supported for units that run within
a mount namespace (i.e. with <b>RootImage=</b>,
<b>PrivateMounts=</b>, etc.). Note that the namespace

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the optional

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the optional

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For most
services, only a small subset of log targets make sense. In
particular, most &quot;normal&quot; services should only

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>reset-failed
[</b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reset the &quot;failed&quot;
state of the specified units, or if no unit name is passed,
reset the state of all units. When a unit fails in some way
(i.e. process exiting with non-zero error code, terminating
abnormally or timing out), it will automatically enter the
&quot;failed&quot; state and its exit code and status is
recorded for introspection by the administrator until the
service is stopped/re-started or reset with this
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
resetting the &quot;failed&quot; state of a unit it also
resets various other per-unit properties: the start rate
limit counter of all unit types is reset to zero, as is the
restart counter of service units. Thus, if a unit's start
limit (as configured with
<i>StartLimitIntervalSec=</i>/<i>StartLimitBurst=</i>) is
hit and the unit refuses to be started again, use this
command to make it startable again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unit File
Commands <br>
list-unit-files</b> [<i>PATTERN...</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List unit files installed on
the system, in combination with their enablement state (as
reported by <b>is-enabled</b>). If one or more
<i>PATTERN</i>s are specified, only unit files whose name
matches one of them are shown (patterns matching unit file
system paths are not supported).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike
<b>list-units</b> this command will list template units in
addition to explicitly instantiated units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>enable</b>
<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b>, <b>enable</b>
<i>PATH</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable one or more units or
unit instances. This will create a set of symlinks, as
encoded in the [Install] sections of the indicated unit
files. After the symlinks have been created, the system
manager configuration is reloaded (in a way equivalent to
<b>daemon-reload</b>), in order to ensure the changes are
taken into account immediately. Note that this does
<i>not</i> have the effect of also starting any of the units
being enabled. If this is desired, combine this command with
the <b>--now</b> switch, or invoke <b>start</b> with
appropriate arguments later. Note that in case of unit
instance enablement (i.e. enablement of units of the form
foo@bar.service), symlinks named the same as instances are
created in the unit configuration directory, however they
point to the single template unit file they are instantiated
from.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command
expects either valid unit names (in which case various unit
file directories are automatically searched for unit files
with appropriate names), or absolute paths to unit files (in
which case these files are read directly). If a specified
unit file is located outside of the usual unit file
directories, an additional symlink is created, linking it
into the unit configuration path, thus ensuring it is found
when requested by commands such as <b>start</b>. The file
system where the linked unit files are located must be
accessible when systemd is started (e.g. anything underneath
/home/ or /var/ is not allowed, unless those directories are
located on the root file system).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command
will print the file system operations executed. This output
may be suppressed by passing <b>--quiet</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
operation creates only the symlinks suggested in the
[Install] section of the unit files. While this command is
the recommended way to manipulate the unit configuration
directory, the administrator is free to make additional
changes manually by placing or removing symlinks below this
directory. This is particularly useful to create
configurations that deviate from the suggested default
installation. In this case, the administrator must make sure
to invoke <b>daemon-reload</b> manually as necessary, in
order to ensure the changes are taken into account.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Enabling units
should not be confused with starting (activating) units, as
done by the <b>start</b> command. Enabling and starting
units is orthogonal: units may be enabled without being
started and started without being enabled. Enabling simply
hooks the unit into various suggested places (for example,
so that the unit is automatically started on boot or when a
particular kind of hardware is plugged in). Starting
actually spawns the daemon process (in case of service
units), or binds the socket (in case of socket units), and
so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Depending on
whether <b>--system</b>, <b>--user</b>, <b>--runtime</b>, or
<b>--global</b> is specified, this enables the unit for the
system, for the calling user only, for only this boot of the
system, or for all future logins of all users. Note that in
the last case, no systemd daemon configuration is
reloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Using
<b>enable</b> on masked units is not supported and results
in an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>disable</b>
<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disables one or more units.
This removes all symlinks to the unit files backing the
specified units from the unit configuration directory, and
hence undoes any changes made by <b>enable</b> or
<b>link</b>. Note that this removes <i>all</i> symlinks to
matching unit files, including manually created symlinks,
and not just those actually created by <b>enable</b> or
<b>link</b>. Note that while <b>disable</b> undoes the
effect of <b>enable</b>, the two commands are otherwise not
symmetric, as <b>disable</b> may remove more symlinks than a
prior <b>enable</b> invocation of the same unit created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command
expects valid unit names only, it does not accept paths to
unit files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the units specified as arguments, all units are disabled
that are listed in the <i>Also=</i> setting contained in the

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command
implicitly reloads the system manager configuration after
completing the operation. Note that this command does not
implicitly stop the units that are being disabled. If this
is desired, either combine this command with the

appropriate arguments later.</p>

<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reenable one or more units, as
specified on the command line. This is a combination of
<b>disable</b> and <b>enable</b> and is useful to reset the
symlinks a unit file is enabled with to the defaults
configured in its [Install] section. This command expects a
unit name only, it does not accept paths to unit files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>preset</b>
<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reset the enable/disable status
one or more unit files, as specified on the command line, to
the defaults configured in the preset policy files. This has

depending how the unit is listed in the preset files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mask</b>
<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Mask one or more units, as
specified on the command line. This will link these unit
files to /dev/null, making it impossible to start them. This
is a stronger version of <b>disable</b>, since it prohibits
all kinds of activation of the unit, including enablement
and manual activation. Use this option with care. This
honors the <b>--runtime</b> option to only mask temporarily
until the next reboot of the system. The <b>--now</b> option
may be used to ensure that the units are also stopped. This
command expects valid unit names only, it does not accept
unit file paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
will create a symlink under the unit's name in
/etc/systemd/system/ (in case <b>--runtime</b> is not
specified) or /run/systemd/system/ (in case <b>--runtime</b>
is specified). If a matching unit file already exists under
these directories this operation will hence fail. This means
that the operation is primarily useful to mask units shipped
by the vendor (as those are shipped in /lib/systemd/system/
and not the aforementioned two directories), but typically
doesn't work for units created locally (as those are
typically placed precisely in the two aforementioned
directories). Similar restrictions apply for <b>--user</b>
mode, in which case the directories are below the user's
home directory however.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>unmask</b>
<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Unmask one or more unit files,
as specified on the command line. This will undo the effect
of <b>mask</b>. This command expects valid unit names only,
it does not accept unit file paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>link</b>
<i>PATH</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Link a unit file that is not in
the unit file search path into the unit file search path.
This command expects an absolute path to a unit file. The
effect of this may be undone with <b>disable</b>. The effect
of this command is that a unit file is made available for
commands such as <b>start</b>, even though it is not
installed directly in the unit search path. The file system
where the linked unit files are located must be accessible
when systemd is started (e.g. anything underneath /home/ or
/var/ is not allowed, unless those directories are located
on the root file system).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>revert</b>
<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Revert one or more unit files
to their vendor versions. This command removes drop-in
configuration files that modify the specified units, as well
as any user-configured unit file that overrides a matching
vendor supplied unit file. Specifically, for a unit
&quot;foo.service&quot; the matching directories
&quot;foo.service.d/&quot; with all their contained files
are removed, both below the persistent and runtime
configuration directories (i.e. below /etc/systemd/system
and /run/systemd/system); if the unit file has a
vendor-supplied version (i.e. a unit file located below
/usr/) any matching persistent or runtime unit file that
overrides it is removed, too. Note that if a unit file has
no vendor-supplied version (i.e. is only defined below
/etc/systemd/system or /run/systemd/system, but not in a
unit file stored below /usr/), then it is not removed. Also,
if a unit is masked, it is unmasked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Effectively,
this command may be used to undo all changes made with
<b>systemctl edit</b>, <b>systemctl set-property</b> and
<b>systemctl mask</b> and puts the original unit file with
its settings back in effect.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>add-wants</b>

specified <i>TARGET</i> for one or more units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>edit</b>
<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Edit a drop-in snippet or a

extend or override the specified unit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Depending on
whether <b>--system</b> (the default), <b>--user</b>, or
<b>--global</b> is specified, this command creates a drop-in
file for each unit either for the system, for the calling
user, or for all futures logins of all users. Then, the
editor (see the &quot;Environment&quot; section below) is
invoked on temporary files which will be written to the real
location if the editor exits successfully.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If

units instead of creating drop-in files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If

exist, new unit files will be opened for editing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If

systemd</b> supports an environment block that is passed to
processes the manager spawns. The names of the variables can
contain ASCII letters, digits, and the underscore character.
Variable names cannot be empty or start with a digit. In
variable values, most characters are allowed, but the whole
sequence must be valid UTF-8. (Note that control characters
like newline (<b>NL</b>), tab (<b>TAB</b>), or the escape
character (<b>ESC</b>), <i>are</i> valid ASCII and thus
valid UTF-8). The total length of the environment block is
limited to <b>_SC_ARG_MAX</b> value defined by
<b>sysconf</b>(3).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>show-environment</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Dump the systemd manager
environment block. This is the environment block that is
passed to all processes the manager spawns. The environment
block will be dumped in straightforward form suitable for
sourcing into most shells. If no special characters or
whitespace is present in the variable values, no escaping is
performed, and the assignments have the form
&quot;VARIABLE=value&quot;. If whitespace or characters
which have special meaning to the shell are present,
dollar-single-quote escaping is used, and assignments have
the form &quot;VARIABLE=$'value'&quot;. This syntax is known
to be supported by <b>bash</b>(1), <b>zsh</b>(1),
<b>ksh</b>(1), and <b>busybox</b>(1)'s <b>ash</b>(1), but

daemon-reload</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reload the systemd manager
configuration. This will rerun all generators (see
<b>systemd.generator</b>(7)), reload all unit files, and
recreate the entire dependency tree. While the daemon is
being reloaded, all sockets systemd listens on behalf of
user configuration will stay accessible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command
should not be confused with the <b>reload</b> command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>daemon-reexec</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reexecute the systemd manager.
This will serialize the manager state, reexecute the process
and deserialize the state again. This command is of little
use except for debugging and package upgrades. Sometimes, it
might be helpful as a heavy-weight <b>daemon-reload</b>.
While the daemon is being reexecuted, all sockets systemd
listening on behalf of user configuration will stay
accessible.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>log-level</b>
[<i>LEVEL</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If no argument is given, print
the current log level of the manager. If an optional
argument <i>LEVEL</i> is provided, then the command changes
the current log level of the manager to <i>LEVEL</i>
(accepts the same values as <b>--log-level=</b> described in
<b>systemd</b>(1)).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>log-target</b>
[<i>TARGET</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If no argument is given, print
the current log target of the manager. If an optional
argument <i>TARGET</i> is provided, then the command changes
the current log target of the manager to <i>TARGET</i>
(accepts the same values as <b>--log-target=</b>, described
in <b>systemd</b>(1)).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>service-watchdogs</b>
[yes|no]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If no argument is given, print
the current state of service runtime watchdogs of the
manager. If an optional boolean argument is provided, then
globally enables or disables the service runtime watchdogs
(<b>WatchdogSec=</b>) and emergency actions (e.g.
<b>OnFailure=</b> or <b>StartLimitAction=</b>); see
<b>systemd.service</b>(5). The hardware watchdog is not
affected by this setting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>System
Commands <br>
is-system-running</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Checks whether the system is
operational. This returns success (exit code 0) when the
system is fully up and running, specifically not in startup,
shutdown or maintenance mode, and with no failed services.
Failure is returned otherwise (exit code non-zero). In
addition, the current state is printed in a short string to
standard output, see the table below. Use <b>--quiet</b> to
suppress this output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use
<b>--wait</b> to wait until the boot process is completed
before printing the current state and returning the
appropriate error status. If <b>--wait</b> is in use, states
<i>initializing</i> or <i>starting</i> will not be reported,
instead the command will block until a later state (such as
<i>running</i> or <i>degraded</i>) is reached.</p>

prints a wall message to all users. This command is
asynchronous; it will return after the halt operation is
enqueued, without waiting for it to complete. Note that this

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>switch-root</b>
<i>ROOT</i> [<i>INIT</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Switches to a different root
directory and executes a new system manager process below
it. This is intended for use in the initrd, and will
transition from the initrd's system manager process (a.k.a.
&quot;init&quot; process) to the main system manager process
which is loaded from the actual host root files system. This
call takes two arguments: the directory that is to become
the new root directory, and the path to the new system
manager binary below it to execute as PID 1. If the latter
is omitted or the empty string, a systemd binary will
automatically be searched for and used as init. If the
system manager path is omitted, equal to the empty string or
identical to the path to the systemd binary, the state of
the initrd's system manager process is passed to the main
system manager, which allows later introspection of the
state of the services involved in the initrd boot phase.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>suspend</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Suspend the system. This will

It will not wait for the suspend/resume cycle to
complete.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hibernate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Hibernate the system. This will

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>suspend-then-hibernate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Suspend the system and
hibernate it after the delay specified in
systemd-sleep.conf. This will trigger activation of the
special target unit suspend-then-hibernate.target. This
command is asynchronous, and will return after the hybrid
sleep operation is successfully enqueued. It will not wait
for the sleep/wake-up or hibernate/thaw cycle to

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Parameter
Syntax</b> <br>
Unit commands listed above take either a single unit name
(designated as <i>UNIT</i>), or multiple unit specifications
(designated as <i>PATTERN</i>...). In the first case, the
unit name with or without a suffix must be given. If the
suffix is not specified (unit name is
&quot;abbreviated&quot;), systemctl will append a suitable
suffix, &quot;.service&quot; by default, and a type-specific
suffix in case of commands which operate only on specific
unit types. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
start sshd</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
start sshd.service</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">are equivalent,
as are</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
isolate default</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
isolate default.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
(absolute) paths to device nodes are automatically converted
to device unit names, and other (absolute) paths to mount
unit names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
status /dev/sda <br>
# systemctl status /home</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">are equivalent
to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
status dev-sda.device <br>
# systemctl status home.mount</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the second
case, shell-style globs will be matched against the primary
names of all units currently in memory; literal unit names,
with or without a suffix, will be treated as in the first
case. This means that literal unit names always refer to
exactly one unit, but globs may match zero units and this is
not considered an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Glob patterns
use <b>fnmatch</b>(3), so normal shell-style globbing rules
are used, and &quot;*&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, &quot;[]&quot;
may be used. See <b>glob</b>(7) for more details. The
patterns are matched against the primary names of units
currently in memory, and patterns which do not match
anything are silently skipped. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
stop sshd@*.service</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will stop all
sshd@.service instances. Note that alias names of units, and
units that aren't in memory are not considered for glob
expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For unit file
commands, the specified <i>UNIT</i> should be the name of
the unit file (possibly abbreviated, see above), or the
absolute path to the unit file:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
enable foo.service</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-t</b>,
<b>--type=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The argument is a
comma-separated list of unit types such as <b>service</b>
and <b>socket</b>. When units are listed with
<b>list-units</b>, <b>show</b>, or <b>status</b>, only units
of the specified types will be shown. By default, units of
all types are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
case, if one of the arguments is <b>help</b>, a list of
allowed values will be printed and the program will
exit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--state=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The argument is a
comma-separated list of unit LOAD, SUB, or ACTIVE states.
When listing units with <b>list-units</b>, <b>show</b>, or
<b>status</b>, show only those in the specified states. Use
<b>--state=failed</b> or <b>--failed</b> to show only failed
units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
case, if one of the arguments is <b>help</b>, a list of
allowed values will be printed and the program will
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-p</b>,
<b>--property=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When showing unit/job/manager
properties with the <b>show</b> command, limit display to
properties specified in the argument. The argument should be
a comma-separated list of property names, such as
&quot;MainPID&quot;. Unless specified, all known properties
are shown. If specified more than once, all properties with
the specified names are shown. Shell completion is
implemented for property names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For the manager
itself, <b>systemctl&nbsp;show</b> will show all available
properties, most of which are derived or closely match the
options described in <b>systemd-system.conf</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Properties for
units vary by unit type, so showing any unit (even a
non-existent one) is a way to list properties pertaining to
this type. Similarly, showing any job will list properties
pertaining to all jobs. Properties for units are documented
in <b>systemd.unit</b>(5), and the pages for individual unit
types <b>systemd.service</b>(5), <b>systemd.socket</b>(5),
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-P</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Equivalent to <b>--value
--property=</b>, i.e. shows the value of the property
without the property name or &quot;=&quot;. Note that using
<b>-P</b> once will also affect all properties listed with
<b>-p</b>/<b>--property=</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-a</b>,
<b>--all</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When listing units with
<b>list-units</b>, also show inactive units and units which
are following other units. When showing unit/job/manager
properties, show all properties regardless whether they are
set or not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To list all
units installed in the file system, use the
<b>list-unit-files</b> command instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When listing
units with <b>list-dependencies</b>, recursively show
dependencies of all dependent units (by default only
dependencies of target units are shown).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
<b>status</b>, show journal messages in full, even if they
include unprintable characters or are very long. By default,
fields with unprintable characters are abbreviated as
&quot;blob data&quot;. (Note that the pager may escape
unprintable characters again.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-r</b>,
<b>--recursive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When listing units, also show
units of local containers. Units of local containers will be
prefixed with the container name, separated by a single
colon character (&quot;:&quot;).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--reverse</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show reverse dependencies
between units with <b>list-dependencies</b>, i.e. follow
dependencies of type <i>WantedBy=</i>, <i>RequiredBy=</i>,
<i>PartOf=</i>, <i>BoundBy=</i>, instead of <i>Wants=</i>
and similar.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--after</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>list-dependencies</b>,
show the units that are ordered before the specified unit.
In other words, recursively list units following the
<i>After=</i> dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that any
<i>After=</i> dependency is automatically mirrored to create
a <i>Before=</i> dependency. Temporal dependencies may be
specified explicitly, but are also created implicitly for
units which are <i>WantedBy=</i> targets (see
<b>systemd.target</b>(5)), and as a result of other
directives (for example <i>RequiresMountsFor=</i>). Both
explicitly and implicitly introduced dependencies are shown
with <b>list-dependencies</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When passed to
the <b>list-jobs</b> command, for each printed job show
which other jobs are waiting for it. May be combined with
<b>--before</b> to show both the jobs waiting for each job
as well as all jobs each job is waiting for.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--before</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>list-dependencies</b>,
show the units that are ordered after the specified unit. In
other words, recursively list units following the
<i>Before=</i> dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When passed to
the <b>list-jobs</b> command, for each printed job show
which other jobs it is waiting for. May be combined with
<b>--after</b> to show both the jobs waiting for each job as

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--with-dependencies</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>status</b>,
<b>cat</b>, <b>list-units</b>, and <b>list-unit-files</b>,
those commands print all specified units and the
dependencies of those units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Options
<b>--reverse</b>, <b>--after</b>, <b>--before</b> may be
used to change what types of dependencies are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-l</b>,
<b>--full</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not ellipsize unit names,
process tree entries, journal output, or truncate unit
descriptions in the output of <b>status</b>,
<b>list-units</b>, <b>list-jobs</b>, and
<b>list-timers</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also, show
installation targets in the output of <b>is-enabled</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--value</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When printing properties with
<b>show</b>, only print the value, and skip the property
name and &quot;=&quot;. Also see option <b>-P</b> above.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--show-types</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When showing sockets, show the
type of the socket.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--job-mode=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When queuing a new job, this
option controls how to deal with already queued jobs. It
takes one of &quot;fail&quot;, &quot;replace&quot;,
&quot;replace-irreversibly&quot;, &quot;isolate&quot;,
&quot;ignore-dependencies&quot;,
&quot;ignore-requirements&quot;, &quot;flush&quot;, or
&quot;triggering&quot;. Defaults to &quot;replace&quot;,
except when the <b>isolate</b> command is used which implies
the &quot;isolate&quot; job mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;fail&quot; is specified and a requested operation
conflicts with a pending job (more specifically: causes an
already pending start job to be reversed into a stop job or
vice versa), cause the operation to fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;replace&quot; (the default) is specified, any
conflicting pending job will be replaced, as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;replace-irreversibly&quot; is specified, operate like
&quot;replace&quot;, but also mark the new jobs as
irreversible. This prevents future conflicting transactions
from replacing these jobs (or even being enqueued while the
irreversible jobs are still pending). Irreversible jobs can
still be cancelled using the <b>cancel</b> command. This job
mode should be used on any transaction which pulls in
shutdown.target.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;isolate&quot;
is only valid for start operations and causes all other
units to be stopped when the specified unit is started. This
mode is always used when the <b>isolate</b> command is
used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;flush&quot;
will cause all queued jobs to be canceled when the new job
is enqueued.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;ignore-dependencies&quot; is specified, then all unit
dependencies are ignored for this new job and the operation
is executed immediately. If passed, no required units of the
unit passed will be pulled in, and no ordering dependencies
will be honored. This is mostly a debugging and rescue tool
for the administrator and should not be used by
applications.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;ignore-requirements&quot;
is similar to &quot;ignore-dependencies&quot;, but only
causes the requirement dependencies to be ignored, the
ordering dependencies will still be honored.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;triggering&quot;
may only be used with <b>systemctl stop</b>. In this mode,
the specified unit and any active units that trigger it are
stopped. See the discussion of <i>Triggers=</i> in
<b>systemd.unit</b>(5) for more information about triggering
units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-T</b>,
<b>--show-transaction</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When enqueuing a unit job (for
example as effect of a <b>systemctl start</b> invocation or
similar), show brief information about all jobs enqueued,
covering both the requested job and any added because of
unit dependencies. Note that the output will only include
jobs immediately part of the transaction requested. It is
possible that service start-up program code run as effect of
the enqueued jobs might request further jobs to be pulled
in. This means that completion of the listed jobs might
ultimately entail more jobs than the listed ones.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--fail</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Shorthand for
<b>--job-mode=</b>fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
the <b>kill</b> command, if no units were killed, the
operation results in an error.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--check-inhibitors=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When system shutdown or sleep
state is requested, this option controls checking of
inhibitor locks. It takes one of &quot;auto&quot;,
&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. Defaults to
&quot;auto&quot;, which will behave like &quot;yes&quot; for
interactive invocations (i.e. from a TTY) and &quot;no&quot;
for non-interactive invocations. &quot;yes&quot; lets the
request respect inhibitor locks. &quot;no&quot; lets the
request ignore inhibitor locks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
can establish inhibitor locks to prevent certain important
operations (such as CD burning) from being interrupted by
system shutdown or sleep. Any user may take these locks and
privileged users may override these locks. If any locks are
taken, shutdown and sleep state requests will normally fail
(unless privileged). However, if &quot;no&quot; is specified
or &quot;auto&quot; is specified on a non-interactive
requests, the operation will be attempted. If locks are

(like <b>show</b>). Errors are always printed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--no-block</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not synchronously wait for
the requested operation to finish. If this is not specified,
the job will be verified, enqueued and <b>systemctl</b> will
wait until the unit's start-up is completed. By passing this
argument, it is only verified and enqueued. This option may
not be combined with <b>--wait</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--wait</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Synchronously wait for started
units to terminate again. This option may not be combined
with <b>--no-block</b>. Note that this will wait forever if
any given unit never terminates (by itself or by getting
stopped explicitly); particularly services which use
&quot;RemainAfterExit=yes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
<b>is-system-running</b>, wait until the boot process is
completed before returning.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--user</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Talk to the service manager of
the calling user, rather than the service manager of the
system.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--system</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Talk to the service manager of
the system. This is the implied default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--failed</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List units in failed state.
This is equivalent to <b>--state=failed</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--no-wall</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not send wall message before

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--global</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>enable</b>

directory, thus enabling or disabling a unit file globally
for all future logins of all users.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--no-reload</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>enable</b>
and <b>disable</b>, do not implicitly reload daemon
configuration after executing the changes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--no-ask-password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>start</b> and
related commands, disables asking for passwords. Background
services may require input of a password or passphrase
string, for example to unlock system hard disks or
cryptographic certificates. Unless this option is specified
and the command is invoked from a terminal, <b>systemctl</b>
will query the user on the terminal for the necessary
secrets. Use this option to switch this behavior off. In
this case, the password must be supplied by some other means
(for example graphical password agents) or the service might
fail. This also disables querying the user for
authentication for privileged operations.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--kill-whom=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>kill</b>,
choose which processes to send a signal to. Must be one of
<b>main</b>, <b>control</b> or <b>all</b> to select whether
to kill only the main process, the control process or all
processes of the unit. The main process of the unit is the
one that defines the life-time of it. A control process of a
unit is one that is invoked by the manager to induce state
changes of it. For example, all processes started due to the
<i>ExecStartPre=</i>, <i>ExecStop=</i> or <i>ExecReload=</i>
settings of service units are control processes. Note that
there is only one control process per unit at a time, as
only one state change is executed at a time. For services of
type <i>Type=forking</i>, the initial process started by the
manager for <i>ExecStart=</i> is a control process, while
the process ultimately forked off by that one is then
considered the main process of the unit (if it can be
determined). This is different for service units of other
types, where the process forked off by the manager for
<i>ExecStart=</i> is always the main process itself. A
service unit consists of zero or one main process, zero or
one control process plus any number of additional processes.
Not all unit types manage processes of these types however.
For example, for mount units, control processes are defined
(which are the invocations of /bin/mount and /bin/umount),
but no main process is defined. If omitted, defaults to
<b>all</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-s</b>,
<b>--signal=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>kill</b>,
choose which signal to send to selected processes. Must be
one of the well-known signal specifiers such as
<b>SIGTERM</b>, <b>SIGINT</b> or <b>SIGSTOP</b>. If omitted,
defaults to <b>SIGTERM</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The special
value &quot;help&quot; will list the known values and the
program will exit immediately, and the special value
&quot;list&quot; will list known values along with the
numerical signal numbers and the program will exit
immediately.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--what=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Select what type of per-unit
resources to remove when the <b>clean</b> command is
invoked, see below. Takes one of <b>configuration</b>,
<b>state</b>, <b>cache</b>, <b>logs</b>, <b>runtime</b> to
select the type of resource. This option may be specified
more than once, in which case all specified resource types
are removed. Also accepts the special value <b>all</b> as a
shortcut for specifying all five resource types. If this
option is not specified defaults to the combination of
<b>cache</b> and <b>runtime</b>, i.e. the two kinds of
resources that are generally considered to be redundant and
can be reconstructed on next invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-f</b>,
<b>--force</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>enable</b>,
overwrite any existing conflicting symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
<b>edit</b>, create all of the specified units which do not
already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
<b>halt</b>, <b>poweroff</b>, <b>reboot</b> or <b>kexec</b>,
execute the selected operation without shutting down all
units. However, all processes will be killed forcibly and
all file systems are unmounted or remounted read-only. This
is hence a drastic but relatively safe option to request an
immediate reboot. If <b>--force</b> is specified twice for
these operations (with the exception of <b>kexec</b>), they
will be executed immediately, without terminating any
processes or unmounting any file systems. Warning:
specifying <b>--force</b> twice with any of these operations
might result in data loss. Note that when <b>--force</b> is
specified twice the selected operation is executed by
<b>systemctl</b> itself, and the system manager is not
contacted. This means the command should succeed even when
the system manager has crashed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--message=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>halt</b>,
<b>poweroff</b> or <b>reboot</b>, set a short message
explaining the reason for the operation. The message will be
logged together with the default shutdown message.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--now</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>enable</b>,
the units will also be started. When used with
<b>disable</b> or <b>mask</b>, the units will also be
stopped. The start or stop operation is only carried out
when the respective enable or disable operation has been
successful.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--root=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with
<b>enable</b>/<b>disable</b>/<b>is-enabled</b> (and related
commands), use the specified root path when looking for unit
files. If this option is present, <b>systemctl</b> will
operate on the file system directly, instead of
communicating with the <b>systemd</b> daemon to carry out
changes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--image=</b><i>image</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a path to a disk image
file or block device node. If specified, all operations are
applied to file system in the indicated disk image. This
option is similar to <b>--root=</b>, but operates on file
systems stored in disk images or block devices. The disk
image should either contain just a file system or a set of
file systems within a GPT partition table, following the
<b><font color="#0000FF">Discoverable Partitions
Specification</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">. For further information on supported

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>--runtime</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">When used
with <b>enable</b>, <b>disable</b>, <b>edit</b>, (and
related commands), make changes only temporarily, so that
they are lost on the next reboot. This will have the effect
that changes are not made in subdirectories of /etc/ but in
/run/, with identical immediate effects, however, since the
latter is lost on reboot, the changes are lost
too.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Similarly,
when used with <b>set-property</b>, make changes only
temporarily, so that they are lost on the next

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>--boot-loader-entry=</b><i>ID</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">When used
with the <b>reboot</b>, <b>poweroff</b>, or <b>halt</b>
command, indicate to the system's boot loader to boot into a

that not all boot loaders support this
functionality.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>--reboot-argument=</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">This

switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this
option.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
the value of <i>$SYSTEMD_LESS</i> does not include
&quot;K&quot;, and the pager that is invoked is <b>less</b>,
Ctrl+C will be ignored by the executable, and needs to be
handled by the pager.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>X</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><font color="#000000">This
option instructs the pager to not send termcap
initialization and deinitialization strings to the terminal.
It is set by default to allow command output to remain
visible in the terminal even after the pager exits.
Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from
working, in particular paged output cannot be scrolled with
the mouse.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">See
<b>less</b>(1) for more discussion.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Override
the charset passed to <b>less</b> (by default
&quot;utf-8&quot;, if the invoking terminal is determined to
be UTF-8 compatible).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument. When true, the &quot;secure&quot; mode of
the pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If
<i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set at all, secure mode
is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner
of the login session, see <b>geteuid</b>(2) and
<b>sd_pid_get_owner_uid</b>(3). In secure mode,
<b>LESSSECURE=1</b> will be set when invoking the pager, and
the pager shall disable commands that open or create new
files or start new subprocesses. When
<i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set at all, pagers which
are not known to implement secure mode will not be used.
(Currently only <b>less</b>(1) implements secure
mode.)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note:
when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for
example under <b>sudo</b>(8) or <b>pkexec</b>(1), care must
be taken to ensure that unintended interactive features are
not enabled. &quot;Secure&quot; mode for the pager may be
enabled automatically as describe above. Setting
<i>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</i> or not removing it from the
inherited environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary
commands. Note that if the <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> or
<i>$PAGER</i> variables are to be honoured,
<i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> must be set too. It might be
reasonable to completely disable the pager using
<b>--no-pager</b> instead.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument. When true, <b>systemd</b> and related
utilities will use colors in their output, otherwise the
output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can
take one of the following special values: &quot;16&quot;,
&quot;256&quot; to restrict the use of colors to the base 16
or 256 ANSI colors, respectively. This can be specified to
override the automatic decision based on <i>$TERM</i> and
what the console is connected to.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The value
must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should
be generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting
this. This can be specified to override the decision that
<b>systemd</b> makes based on <i>$TERM</i> and other
conditions.</font></p>
