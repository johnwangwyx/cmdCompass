<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gzip, gunzip,
zcat - compress or expand files</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gzip</b> [
<b>-acdfhklLnNrtvV19</b> ] [<b>-S&nbsp;suffix</b>] [ <i>name
...</i> ] <b><br>
gunzip</b> [ <b>-acfhklLnNrtvV</b> ] [<b>-S&nbsp;suffix</b>]
[ <i>name ...</i> ] <b><br>
zcat</b> [ <b>-fhLV</b> ] [ <i>name ...</i> ]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>gzip</b>
command reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv
coding (LZ77). Whenever possible, each file is replaced by
one with the extension <b>.gz</b>, while keeping the same
ownership modes, access and modification times. (The default
extension is <b>z</b> for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT, Windows NT FAT
and Atari.) If no files are specified, or if a file name is
&quot;-&quot;, the standard input is compressed to the
standard output. The <b>gzip</b> command will only attempt
to compress regular files. In particular, it will ignore
symbolic links.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
compressed file name is too long for its file system,
<b>gzip</b> truncates it. The <b>gzip</b> command attempts
to truncate only the parts of the file name longer than 3
characters. (A part is delimited by dots.) If the name
consists of small parts only, the longest parts are
truncated. For example, if file names are limited to 14
characters, gzip.msdos.exe is compressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz.
Names are not truncated on systems which do not have a limit
on file name length.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
<b>gzip</b> keeps the original file name and timestamp in
the compressed file. These are used when decompressing the
file with the <b>-N</b> option. This is useful when the
compressed file name was truncated or when the timestamp was
not preserved after a file transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Compressed
files can be restored to their original form using <b>gzip
-d</b> or <b>gunzip</b> or <b>zcat</b>. If the original name
saved in the compressed file is not suitable for its file
system, a new name is constructed from the original one to
make it legal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gunzip</b>
takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each
file whose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring
case) and which begins with the correct magic number with an
uncompressed file without the original extension.
<b>gunzip</b> also recognizes the special extensions
<b>.tgz</b> and <b>.taz</b> as shorthands for <b>.tar.gz</b>
and <b>.tar.Z</b> respectively. When compressing,
<b>gzip</b> uses the <b>.tgz</b> extension if necessary
instead of truncating a file with a <b>.tar</b>
extension.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gunzip</b>
can currently decompress files created by <b>gzip</b>,
<b>zip</b>, <b>compress</b>, <b>compress -H</b> or
<b>pack</b>. The detection of the input format is automatic.
When using the first two formats, <b>gunzip</b> checks a 32
bit CRC. For <b>pack</b> and <b>gunzip</b> checks the
uncompressed length. The standard <b>compress</b> format was
not designed to allow consistency checks. However
<b>gunzip</b> is sometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If
you get an error when uncompressing a .Z file, do not assume
that the .Z file is correct simply because the standard
<b>uncompress</b> does not complain. This generally means
that the standard <b>uncompress</b> does not check its
input, and happily generates garbage output. The SCO
compress -H format (lzh compression method) does not include
a CRC but also allows some consistency checks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files created
by <b>zip</b> can be uncompressed by gzip only if they have
a single member compressed with the &rsquo;deflation&rsquo;
method. This feature is only intended to help conversion of
tar.zip files to the tar.gz format. To extract a <b>zip</b>
file with a single member, use a command like
&rsquo;<b>gunzip &lt;foo.zip</b>&rsquo; or &rsquo;<b>gunzip
-S .zip foo.zip</b>&rsquo;. To extract zip files with
several members, use <b>unzip</b> instead of
<b>gunzip</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>zcat</b>
command is identical to <b>gunzip -c</b>. (On some systems,
<b>zcat</b> may be installed as <b>gzcat</b> to preserve the
original link to <b>compress</b>.) <b>zcat</b> uncompresses
either a list of files on the command line or its standard
input and writes the uncompressed data on standard output.
<b>zcat</b> will uncompress files that have the correct
magic number whether they have a <b>.gz</b> suffix or
not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>gzip</b>
command uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in <b>zip</b> and
PKZIP. The amount of compression obtained depends on the
size of the input and the distribution of common substrings.
Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced by
60-70%. Compression is generally much better than that
achieved by LZW (as used in <b>compress</b>), Huffman coding
(as used in <b>pack</b>), or adaptive Huffman coding
(<b>compact</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Compression is
always performed, even if the compressed file is slightly
larger than the original. The worst case expansion is a few
bytes for the gzip file header, plus 5 bytes per 32&nbsp;KiB
block, or an expansion ratio of 0.015% for large files. The
actual number of used disk blocks almost never
increases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>gzip</b>
normally preserves the mode and modification timestamp of a
file when compressing or decompressing. If you have
appropriate privileges, it also preserves the file&rsquo;s
owner and group.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>-a
--ascii</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Ascii text mode: convert
end-of-lines using local conventions. This option is
supported only on some non-Unix systems. For MSDOS, CR LF is
converted to LF when compressing, and LF is converted to CR
LF when decompressing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-c --stdout
--to-stdout</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Write output on standard
output; keep original files unchanged. If there are several
input files, the output consists of a sequence of
independently compressed members. To obtain better
compression, concatenate all input files before compressing
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-d --decompress
--uncompress</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Decompress.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-f --force</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Force compression or
decompression even if the file has multiple links or the
corresponding file already exists, or if the compressed data
is read from or written to a terminal. If the input data is
not in a format recognized by <b>gzip</b>, and if the option
--stdout is also given, copy the input data without change
to the standard output: let <b>zcat</b> behave as
<b>cat</b>. If <b>-f</b> is not given, and when not running
in the background, <b>gzip</b> prompts to verify whether an
existing file should be overwritten.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-h --help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Display a help screen and
quit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-k --keep</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Keep (don&rsquo;t delete) input
files during compression or decompression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-l --list</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For each compressed file, list
the following fields:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">compressed
size: size of the compressed file <br>
uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file <br>
ratio: compression ratio (0.0% if unknown) <br>
uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
uncompressed size is given as -1 for files not in gzip
format, such as compressed .Z files. To get the uncompressed
size for such a file, you can use:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">zcat file.Z |
wc -c</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In combination
with the --verbose option, the following fields are also
displayed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">method:
compression method <br>
crc: the 32-bit CRC of the uncompressed data <br>
date &amp; time: timestamp for the uncompressed file</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The compression
methods currently supported are deflate, compress, lzh (SCO
compress -H) and pack. The crc is given as ffffffff for a
file not in gzip format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With --name,
the uncompressed name, date and time are those stored within
the compress file if present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">With --verbose,
the size totals and compression ratio for all files is also
displayed, unless some sizes are unknown. With --quiet, the
title and totals lines are not displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-L --license</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Display the <b>gzip</b> license
and quit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-n --no-name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When compressing, do not save
the original file name and timestamp by default. (The
original name is always saved if the name had to be
truncated.) When decompressing, do not restore the original
file name if present (remove only the <b>gzip</b> suffix
from the compressed file name) and do not restore the
original timestamp if present (copy it from the compressed
file). This option is the default when decompressing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-N --name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When compressing, always save
the original file name, and save the seconds part of the
original modification timestamp if the original is a regular
file and its timestamp is at least 1 (1970-01-01 00:00:01
UTC) and is less than 2**32 (2106-02-07 06:28:16 UTC,
assuming leap seconds are not counted); this is the default.
When decompressing, restore from the saved file name and
timestamp if present. This option is useful on systems which
have a limit on file name length or when the timestamp has
been lost after a file transfer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-q --quiet</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Suppress all warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-r --recursive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Travel the directory structure
recursively. If any of the file names specified on the
command line are directories, <b>gzip</b> will descend into
the directory and compress all the files it finds there (or
decompress them in the case of <b>gunzip</b> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-S .suf --suffix
.suf</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When compressing, use suffix
.suf instead of .gz. Any non-empty suffix can be given, but
suffixes other than .z and .gz should be avoided to avoid
confusion when files are transferred to other systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When
decompressing, add .suf to the beginning of the list of
suffixes to try, when deriving an output file name from an
input file name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--synchronous</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use synchronous output. With
this option, <b>gzip</b> is less likely to lose data during
a system crash, but it can be considerably slower.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-t --test</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Test. Check the compressed file
integrity then quit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-v --verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Verbose. Display the name and
percentage reduction for each file compressed or
decompressed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-V --version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Version. Display the version
number and compilation options then quit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-# --fast --best</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Regulate the speed of
compression using the specified digit <b>#</b>, where
<b>-1</b> or <b>--fast</b> indicates the fastest compression
method (less compression) and <b>-9</b> or <b>--best</b>
indicates the slowest compression method (best compression).
The default compression level is <b>-6</b> (that is, biased
towards high compression at expense of speed).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--rsyncable</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When you synchronize a
compressed file between two computers, this option allows
rsync to transfer only files that were changed in the
archive instead of the entire archive. Normally, after a
change is made to any file in the archive, the compression
algorithm can generate a new version of the archive that
does not match the previous version of the archive. In this
case, rsync transfers the entire new version of the archive
to the remote computer. With this option, rsync can transfer
only the changed files as well as a small amount of metadata
that is required to update the archive structure in the area
that was changed.</p>

<h2>ADVANCED USAGE
<a name="ADVANCED USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Multiple
compressed files can be concatenated. In this case,
<b>gunzip</b> will extract all members at once. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gzip -c file1
&gt; foo.gz <br>
gzip -c file2 &gt;&gt; foo.gz</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gunzip -c
foo</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is equivalent
to</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">cat file1
file2</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In case of
damage to one member of a .gz file, other members can still
be recovered (if the damaged member is removed). However,
you can get better compression by compressing all members at
once:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">cat file1 file2
| gzip &gt; foo.gz</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">compresses
better than</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gzip -c file1
file2 &gt; foo.gz</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
recompress concatenated files to get better compression,
do:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gzip -cd old.gz
| gzip &gt; new.gz</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a compressed
file consists of several members, the uncompressed size and
CRC reported by the --list option applies to the last member
only. If you need the uncompressed size for all members, you
can use:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gzip -cd
file.gz | wc -c</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you wish to
create a single archive file with multiple members so that
members can later be extracted independently, use an
archiver such as tar or zip. GNU tar supports the -z option
to invoke gzip transparently. gzip is designed as a
complement to tar, not as a replacement.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The obsolescent
environment variable <b>GZIP</b> can hold a set of default
options for <b>gzip</b>. These options are interpreted first
and can be overwritten by explicit command line parameters.
As this can cause problems when using scripts, this feature
is supported only for options that are reasonably likely to
not cause too much harm, and <b>gzip</b> warns if it is
used. This feature will be removed in a future release of
<b>gzip</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can use an
alias or script instead. For example, if <b>gzip</b> is in
the directory <b>/usr/bin</b> you can prepend
<b>$HOME/bin</b> to your <b>PATH</b> and create an
executable script <b>$HOME/bin/gzip</b> containing the
following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#! /bin/sh <br>
export PATH=/usr/bin <br>
exec gzip -9 &quot;$@&quot;</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Exit status is
normally 0; if an error occurs, exit status is 1. If a
warning occurs, exit status is 2. <br>
Usage: gzip [-cdfhklLnNrtvV19] [-S suffix] [file ...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Invalid options were specified
on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>file</i>: not in gzip
format</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The file specified to
<b>gunzip</b> has not been compressed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>file</i>: Corrupt input. Use
zcat to recover some data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The compressed file has been
damaged. The data up to the point of failure can be
recovered using</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">zcat
<i>file</i> &gt; recover</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>file</i>: compressed with
<i>xx</i> bits, can only handle <i>yy</i> bits</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>File</b> was compressed
(using LZW) by a program that could deal with more bits than
the decompress code on this machine. Recompress the file
with gzip, which compresses better and uses less memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>file</i>: already has .gz

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The file is assumed to be
already compressed. Rename the file and try again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>file</i> already exists; do
you wish to overwrite (y or n)?</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Respond &quot;y&quot; if you
want the output file to be replaced; &quot;n&quot; if
not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">gunzip: corrupt input</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A SIGSEGV violation was
detected which usually means that the input file has been
corrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>xx.x%</i> Percentage of the
input saved by compression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">(Relevant only for <b>-v</b>
and <b>-l</b>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-- not a regular file or
directory: ignored</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When the input file is not a
regular file or directory, (e.g. a symbolic link, socket,
FIFO, device file), it is left unaltered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">-- has <i>xx</i> other links:
unchanged</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The input file has links; it is
left unchanged. See <b>ln</b>(1) for more information. Use
the <b>-f</b> flag to force compression of multiply-linked
files.</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When writing
compressed data to a tape, it is generally necessary to pad
the output with zeroes up to a block boundary. When the data
is read and the whole block is passed to <b>gunzip</b> for
decompression, <b>gunzip</b> detects that there is extra
trailing garbage after the compressed data and emits a
warning by default. You can use the --quiet option to
suppress the warning.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In some rare
cases, the --best option gives worse compression than the
default compression level (-6). On some highly redundant
files, <b>compress</b> compresses better than
<b>gzip</b>.</p>
