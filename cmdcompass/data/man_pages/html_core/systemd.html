<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">systemd is a
system and service manager for Linux operating systems. When
run as first process on boot (as PID 1), it acts as init
system that brings up and maintains userspace services.
Separate instances are started for logged-in users to start
their services.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd</b>
is usually not invoked directly by the user, but is
installed as the /sbin/init symlink and started during early
boot. The user manager instances are started automatically
through the <b>user@.service</b>(5) service.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
compatibility with SysV, if the binary is called as
<b>init</b> and is not the first process on the machine (PID
is not 1), it will execute <b>telinit</b> and pass all
command line arguments unmodified. That means <b>init</b>
and <b>telinit</b> are mostly equivalent when invoked from
normal login sessions. See <b>telinit</b>(8) for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When run as a
system instance, systemd interprets the configuration file
system.conf and the files in system.conf.d directories; when
run as a user instance, systemd interprets the configuration
file user.conf and the files in user.conf.d directories. See
<b>systemd-system.conf</b>(5) for more information.</p>

<h2>CONCEPTS
<a name="CONCEPTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">systemd
provides a dependency system between various entities called
&quot;units&quot; of 11 different types. Units encapsulate
various objects that are relevant for system boot-up and
maintenance. The majority of units are configured in unit
configuration files, whose syntax and basic set of options
is described in <b>systemd.unit</b>(5), however some are
created automatically from other configuration files,
dynamically from system state or programmatically at
runtime. Units may be &quot;active&quot; (meaning started,
bound, plugged in, ..., depending on the unit type, see
below), or &quot;inactive&quot; (meaning stopped, unbound,
unplugged, ...), as well as in the process of being
activated or deactivated, i.e. between the two states (these
states are called &quot;activating&quot;,
&quot;deactivating&quot;). A special &quot;failed&quot;
state is available as well, which is very similar to
&quot;inactive&quot; and is entered when the service failed
in some way (process returned error code on exit, or
crashed, an operation timed out, or after too many
restarts). If this state is entered, the cause will be
logged, for later reference. Note that the various unit
types may have a number of additional substates, which are
mapped to the five generalized unit states described
here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
unit types are available:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. Service
units, which start and control daemons and the processes
they consist of. For details, see
<b>systemd.service</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. Socket
units, which encapsulate local IPC or network sockets in the
system, useful for socket-based activation. For details
about socket units, see <b>systemd.socket</b>(5), for
details on socket-based activation and other forms of
activation, see <b>daemon</b>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. Target units
are useful to group units, or provide well-known
synchronization points during boot-up, see
<b>systemd.target</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">4. Device units
expose kernel devices in systemd and may be used to
implement device-based activation. For details, see
<b>systemd.device</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">5. Mount units
control mount points in the file system, for details see
<b>systemd.mount</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">6. Automount
units provide automount capabilities, for on-demand mounting
of file systems as well as parallelized boot-up. See
<b>systemd.automount</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">7. Timer units
are useful for triggering activation of other units based on
timers. You may find details in <b>systemd.timer</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">8. Swap units
are very similar to mount units and encapsulate memory swap
partitions or files of the operating system. They are
described in <b>systemd.swap</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">9. Path units
may be used to activate other services when file system
objects change or are modified. See
<b>systemd.path</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">10. Slice units
may be used to group units which manage system processes
(such as service and scope units) in a hierarchical tree for
resource management purposes. See
<b>systemd.slice</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">11. Scope units
are similar to service units, but manage foreign processes
instead of starting them as well. See
<b>systemd.scope</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Units are named
as their configuration files. Some units have special
semantics. A detailed list is available in
<b>systemd.special</b>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">systemd knows
various kinds of dependencies, including positive and
negative requirement dependencies (i.e. <i>Requires=</i> and
<i>Conflicts=</i>) as well as ordering dependencies
(<i>After=</i> and <i>Before=</i>). NB: ordering and
requirement dependencies are orthogonal. If only a
requirement dependency exists between two units (e.g.
foo.service requires bar.service), but no ordering
dependency (e.g. foo.service after bar.service) and both are
requested to start, they will be started in parallel. It is
a common pattern that both requirement and ordering
dependencies are placed between two units. Also note that
the majority of dependencies are implicitly created and
maintained by systemd. In most cases, it should be
unnecessary to declare additional dependencies manually,
however it is possible to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Application
programs and units (via dependencies) may request state
changes of units. In systemd, these requests are
encapsulated as 'jobs' and maintained in a job queue. Jobs
may succeed or can fail, their execution is ordered based on
the ordering dependencies of the units they have been
scheduled for.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On boot systemd
activates the target unit default.target whose job is to
activate on-boot services and other on-boot units by pulling
them in via dependencies. Usually, the unit name is just an
alias (symlink) for either graphical.target (for
fully-featured boots into the UI) or multi-user.target (for
limited console-only boots for use in embedded or server
environments, or similar; a subset of graphical.target).
However, it is at the discretion of the administrator to
configure it as an alias to any other target unit. See
<b>systemd.special</b>(7) for details about these target
units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On first boot,
<b>systemd</b> will enable or disable units according to
preset policy. See <b>systemd.preset</b>(5) and &quot;First
Boot Semantics&quot; in <b>machine-id</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">systemd only
keeps a minimal set of units loaded into memory.
Specifically, the only units that are kept loaded into
memory are those for which at least one of the following
conditions is true:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. It is in an
active, activating, deactivating or failed state (i.e. in
any unit state except for &quot;inactive&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. It has a job
queued for it</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. It is a
dependency of at least one other unit that is loaded into
memory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">4. It has some
form of resource still allocated (e.g. a service unit that
is inactive but for which a process is still lingering that
ignored the request to be terminated)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">5. It has been
pinned into memory programmatically by a D-Bus call</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">systemd will
automatically and implicitly load units from disk &mdash; if
they are not loaded yet &mdash; as soon as operations are
requested for them. Thus, in many respects, the fact whether
a unit is loaded or not is invisible to clients. Use
<b>systemctl list-units --all</b> to comprehensively list
all units currently loaded. Any unit for which none of the
conditions above applies is promptly unloaded. Note that
when a unit is unloaded from memory its accounting data is
flushed out too. However, this data is generally not lost,
as a journal log record is generated declaring the consumed
resources whenever a unit shuts down.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Processes
systemd spawns are placed in individual Linux control groups
named after the unit which they belong to in the private
systemd hierarchy. (see <b><font color="#0000FF">Control
Groups v2</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">for more information about control
groups, or short &quot;cgroups&quot;). systemd uses this to
effectively keep track of processes. Control group
information is maintained in the kernel, and is accessible
via the file system hierarchy (beneath /sys/fs/cgroup/), or
in tools such as <b>systemd-cgls</b>(1) or <b>ps</b>(1)
(<b>ps xawf -eo pid,user,cgroup,args</b> is particularly
useful to list all processes and the systemd units they
belong to.).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">systemd
is compatible with the SysV init system to a large degree:
SysV init scripts are supported and simply read as an
alternative (though limited) configuration file format. The
SysV /dev/initctl interface is provided, and compatibility
implementations of the various SysV client tools are
available. In addition to that, various established Unix
functionality such as /etc/fstab or the utmp database are
supported.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">systemd
has a minimal transaction system: if a unit is requested to
start up or shut down it will add it and all its
dependencies to a temporary transaction. Then, it will
verify if the transaction is consistent (i.e. whether the
ordering of all units is cycle-free). If it is not, systemd
will try to fix it up, and removes non-essential jobs from
the transaction that might remove the loop. Also, systemd
tries to suppress non-essential jobs in the transaction that
would stop a running service. Finally it is checked whether
the jobs of the transaction contradict jobs that have
already been queued, and optionally the transaction is
aborted then. If all worked out and the transaction is
consistent and minimized in its impact it is merged with all
already outstanding jobs and added to the run queue.
Effectively this means that before executing a requested
operation, systemd will verify that it makes sense, fixing
it if possible, and only failing if it really cannot
work.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that transactions are generated independently of a unit's
state at runtime, hence, for example, if a start job is
requested on an already started unit, it will still generate
a transaction and wake up any inactive dependencies (and
cause propagation of other jobs as per the defined
relationships). This is because the enqueued job is at the
time of execution compared to the target unit's state and is
marked successful and complete when both satisfy. However,
this job also pulls in other dependencies due to the defined
relationships and thus leads to, in our example, start jobs
for any of those inactive units getting queued as
well.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">systemd
contains native implementations of various tasks that need
to be executed as part of the boot process. For example, it
sets the hostname or configures the loopback network device.
It also sets up and mounts various API file systems, such as
/sys/ or /proc/.</font></p>

<h2>DIRECTORIES
<a name="DIRECTORIES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">System
unit directories</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The
systemd system manager reads unit configuration from various
directories. Packages that want to install unit files shall
place them in the directory returned by <b>pkg-config
systemd --variable=systemdsystemunitdir</b>. Other
directories checked are /usr/local/lib/systemd/system and
/lib/systemd/system. User configuration always takes
precedence. <b>pkg-config systemd
--variable=systemdsystemconfdir</b> returns the path of the
system configuration directory. Packages should alter the
content of these directories only with the <b>enable</b> and
<b>disable</b> commands of the <b>systemctl</b>(1) tool.
Full list of directories is provided in
<b>systemd.unit</b>(5).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">User
unit directories</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Similar
rules apply for the user unit directories. However, here
the</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">XDG Base Directory
specification</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[6]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">is followed to find units.
Applications should place their unit files in the directory
returned by <b>pkg-config systemd
--variable=systemduserunitdir</b>. Global configuration is
done in the directory reported by <b>pkg-config systemd
--variable=systemduserconfdir</b>. The <b>enable</b> and
<b>disable</b> commands of the <b>systemctl</b>(1) tool can
handle both global (i.e. for all users) and private (for one
user) enabling/disabling of units. Full list of directories
is provided in <b>systemd.unit</b>(5).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">SysV
init scripts directory</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The
location of the SysV init script directory varies between
distributions. If systemd cannot find a native unit file for
a requested service, it will look for a SysV init script of
the same name (with the .service suffix removed).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">SysV
runlevel link farm directory</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The
location of the SysV runlevel link farm directory varies
between distributions. systemd will take the link farm into
account when figuring out whether a service shall be
enabled. Note that a service unit with a native unit
configuration file cannot be started by activating it in the
SysV runlevel link farm.</font></p>

<h2>SIGNALS
<a name="SIGNALS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>SIGTERM</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Upon
receiving this signal the systemd system manager serializes
its state, reexecutes itself and deserializes the saved
state again. This is mostly equivalent to <b>systemctl
daemon-reexec</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">systemd
user managers will start the exit.target unit when this
signal is received. This is mostly equivalent to
<b>systemctl --user start exit.target
--job-mode=replace-irreversibly</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>SIGINT</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Upon
receiving this signal the systemd system manager will start
the ctrl-alt-del.target unit. This is mostly equivalent to
<b>systemctl start ctrl-alt-del.target
--job-mode=replace-irreversibly</b>. If this signal is
received more than 7 times per 2s, an immediate reboot is
triggered. Note that pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del on the console
will trigger this signal. Hence, if a reboot is hanging,
pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del more than 7 times in 2 seconds is a
relatively safe way to trigger an immediate
reboot.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">systemd
user managers treat this signal the same way as
<b>SIGTERM</b>.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">When this

when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for
example under <b>sudo</b>(8) or <b>pkexec</b>(1), care must
be taken to ensure that unintended interactive features are
not enabled. &quot;Secure&quot; mode for the pager may be
enabled automatically as describe above. Setting

inherited environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary
commands. Note that if the <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> or

<h2>KERNEL COMMAND LINE
<a name="KERNEL COMMAND LINE"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
run as the system instance, systemd parses a number of
options listed below. They can be specified as kernel
command line arguments which are parsed from a number of
sources depending on the environment in which systemd is
executed. If run inside a Linux container, these options are
parsed from the command line arguments passed to systemd
itself, next to any of the command line options listed in
the Options section above. If run outside of Linux
containers, these arguments are parsed from /proc/cmdline
and from the &quot;SystemdOptions&quot; EFI variable (on EFI
systems) instead. Options from /proc/cmdline have higher
priority. The following variables are understood:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>systemd.unit=</i>,
<i>rd.systemd.unit=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Overrides
the unit to activate on boot. Defaults to default.target.
This may be used to temporarily boot into a different boot
unit, for example rescue.target or emergency.service. See
<b>systemd.special</b>(7) for details about these units. The
option prefixed with &quot;rd.&quot; is honored only in the
initrd, while the one that is not prefixed only in the main
system.</font></p>

core when it crashes. Otherwise, no core dump is created.
Defaults to enabled.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>systemd.crash_chvt</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
positive integer, or a boolean argument. Can be also
specified without an argument, with the same effect as a
positive boolean. If a positive integer (in the range
1&ndash;63) is specified, the system manager (PID 1) will
activate the specified virtual terminal when it crashes.
Defaults to disabled, meaning that no such switch is
attempted. If set to enabled, the virtual terminal the
kernel messages are written to is used instead.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>systemd.crash_shell</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument or enables the option if specified without
an argument. If enabled, the system manager (PID 1) spawns a
shell when it crashes, after a 10s delay. Otherwise, no
shell is spawned. Defaults to disabled, for security
reasons, as the shell is not protected by password
authentication.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>systemd.crash_reboot</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument or enables the option if specified without
an argument. If enabled, the system manager (PID 1) will
reboot the machine automatically when it crashes, after a
10s delay. Otherwise, the system will hang indefinitely.
Defaults to disabled, in order to avoid a reboot loop. If
combined with <i>systemd.crash_shell</i>, the system is
rebooted after the shell exits.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>systemd.confirm_spawn</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument or a path to the virtual console where the
confirmation messages should be emitted. Can be also
specified without an argument, with the same effect as a
positive boolean. If enabled, the system manager (PID 1)
asks for confirmation when spawning processes using
<b>/dev/console</b>. If a path or a console name (such as
&quot;ttyS0&quot;) is provided, the virtual console pointed
to by this path or described by the give name will be used
instead. Defaults to disabled.</font></p>

(<b>WatchdogSec=</b>) and emergency actions (e.g.
<b>OnFailure=</b> or <b>StartLimitAction=</b>) are ignored
by the system manager (PID 1); see
<b>systemd.service</b>(5). Defaults to enabled, i.e.

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument or the constants <b>error</b> and
<b>auto</b>. Can be also specified without an argument, with
the same effect as a positive boolean. If enabled, the
systemd manager (PID 1) shows terse service status updates
on the console during bootup. With <b>error</b>, only
messages about failures are shown, but boot is otherwise
quiet. <b>auto</b> behaves like <b>false</b> until there is
a significant delay in boot. Defaults to enabled, unless
<b>quiet</b> is passed as kernel command line option, in
which case it defaults to <b>error</b>. If specified
overrides the system manager configuration file option
<b>ShowStatus=</b>, see
<b>systemd-system.conf</b>(5).</font></p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>systemd</b>
is only very rarely invoked directly, since it is started
early and is already running by the time users may interact
with it. Normally, tools like <b>systemctl</b>(1) are used
to give commands to the manager. Since <b>systemd</b> is
usually not invoked directly, the options listed below are
mostly useful for debugging and special purposes.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Introspection
and debugging options</b> <br>
Those options are used for testing and introspection, and
<b>systemd</b> may be invoked with them at any
time:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>--dump-configuration-items</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Dump
understood unit configuration items. This outputs a terse
but complete list of configuration items understood in unit
definition files.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>--dump-bus-properties</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Dump
exposed bus properties. This outputs a terse but complete
list of properties exposed on D-Bus.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>--test</b></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Determine
the initial start-up transaction (i.e. the list of jobs
enqueued at start-up), dump it and exit &mdash; without
actually executing any of the determined jobs. This option
is useful for debugging only. Note that during regular
service manager start-up additional units not shown by this
operation may be started, because hardware, socket, bus or
other kinds of activation might add additional jobs as the
transaction is executed. Use <b>--system</b> to request the
initial transaction of the system service manager (this is
also the implied default), combine with <b>--user</b> to
request the initial transaction of the per-user service
manager instead.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>--system</b>,
<b>--user</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">When used
in conjunction with <b>--test</b>, selects whether to
calculate the initial transaction for the system instance or
for a per-user instance. These options have no effect when
invoked without <b>--test</b>, as during regular (i.e.
non-<b>--test</b>) invocations the service manager will
automatically detect whether it shall operate in system or
per-user mode, by checking whether the PID it is run as is 1
or not. Note that it is not supported booting and
maintaining a system with the service manager running in
<b>--system</b> mode but with a PID other than 1.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>-h</b>,
<b>--help</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Print a
short help text and exit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>--version</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Print a
short version string and exit.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Options
that duplicate kernel command line settings</b> <br>
Those options correspond directly to options listed above in
&quot;Kernel Command Line&quot;. Both forms may be used
equivalently for the system manager, but it is recommended
to use the forms listed above in this context, because they
are properly namespaced. When an option is specified both on
the kernel command line and as a normal command line
argument, the latter has higher precedence.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
<b>systemd</b> is used as a user manager, the kernel command
line is ignored and only the options described below are
understood. Nevertheless, <b>systemd</b> is usually started
in this mode through the <b>user@.service</b>(5) service,
which is shared between all users. It may be more convenient
to use configuration files to modify settings (see
<b>systemd-user.conf</b>(5)), or environment variables. See
the &quot;Environment&quot; section above for a discussion
of how the environment block is set.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>--unit=</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Set
