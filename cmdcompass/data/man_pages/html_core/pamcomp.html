<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This program is
part of <b>Netpbm</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pamcomp</b>
reads two images and produces a composite image with one of
the images overlayed on top of the other, possible
translucently. The images need not be the same size. The
input and outputs are Netpbm format image files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In its simplest
use, <b>pamcomp</b> simply places the image in the file
<i>overlay_file</i> on top of the image in the file
<i>underlying_file</i>, blocking out the part of
<i>underlying_file</i> beneath it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you add the
<b>-alpha</b> option, then <b>pamcomp</b> uses the image in
file <i>alpha-pgmfile</i> as a transparency mask, which
means it determines the level of transparency of each point
in the overlay image. The transparency mask must have the
same dimensions as the overlay image. In places where the
transparency mask defines the overlay image to be opaque,
the composite output contains only the contents of the
overlay image; the underlying image is totally blocked out.
In places where the transparency mask defines the overlay
image to be transparent, the composite output contains none
of the overlay image; the underlying image shows through
completely. In places where the transparency mask shows a
value in between opaque and transparent (translucence), the
composite image contains a mixture of the overlay image and
the underlying image and the level of translucence
determines how much of each.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
transparency mask is a PGM file in which a white pixel
represents opaqueness and a black pixel transparency.
Anything in between is translucent. (Like any Netpbm
program, <b>pamcomp</b> will see a PBM file as if it is
PGM).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the overlay
image is a PAM image of tuple type RGB_ALPHA or
GRAYSCALE_ALPHA, then the overlay image contains
transparency information itself and <b>pamcomp</b> uses it
the same way as the transparency mask described above. If
you supply both an overlay image that has transparency
information and a transparency mask, <b>pamcomp</b>
multiplies the two opacities to get the opacity of the
overlay pixel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.25 (October 2004), <b>pamcomp</b> did not recognize the
transparency information in a PAM image -- it just ignored
it. So people had to make appropriate transparency masks in
order to have a non-opaque overlay. Some Netpbm programs
that convert from image formats that contain transparency
information are not able to create RGB_ALPHA or
GRAYSCALE_ALPHA PAM output, so you have to use the old
method -- extract the transparency information from the
original into a separate transparency mask and use that as
input to <b>pamcomp</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output
image is always of the same dimensions as the underlying
image. <b>pamcomp</b> uses only parts of the overlay image
that fit within the underlying image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output
image is a PAM image. Its tuples are color, grayscale, or
black and white, whichever is the &quot;highest&quot; format
between the two input images. The maxval of the output is
the least common multiple of the maxvals of the input, up to
the maximum possible PAM maxval, 65535.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output has
an opacity channel if and only if the underlying image does,
and then the opacities are as described under the
<b>-mixtransparency</b> option. Before Netpbm 10.56
(September 2011), the output never has an opacity
channel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To specify
where on the underlying image to place the overlay image,
use the <b>-align</b>, <b>-valign</b>, <b>-xoff</b>, and
<b>-yoff</b> options. Without these options, the default
horizontal position is flush left and the default vertical
position is flush top.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The overlay
image, in the position you specify, need not fit entirely
within the underlying image. <b>pamcomp</b> uses only the
parts of the overlay image that appear above the underlying
image. It is possible to specify positioning such that
<i>none</i> of the overlay image is over the underlying
image -- i.e. the overlay is out of frame. If you do that,
<b>pamcomp</b> issues a warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The overlay and
underlying images may be of different formats (e.g.
overlaying a PBM text image over a full color PPM image) and
have different maxvals. The output image has the more
general of the two input formats and a maxval that is the
least common multiple the two maxvals (or the maximum maxval
allowable by the format, if the LCM is more than that).</p>

<h2>ARGUMENTS
<a name="ARGUMENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>overlay_file</i> argument is the name of the file
containing the <br>
overly image, while <i>underlying_file</i> is the name of
the file <br>
containing the underlying image. For either, you may specify
&rsquo;-&rsquo; <br>
to indicate Standard Input, and <i>underlying</i> file
defaults to Standard <br>
Input. Make sure you aren&rsquo;t specifying (or defaulting)
Standard Input as <br>
both.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that there
may be a third input file, identified by an
<b>-alphafile</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>output_file</i> argument is the name of the file to which
<b><br>
pamcomp</b> writes the output, creating or truncating it
first. You may <br>
specify &rsquo;-&rsquo; to indicate Standard Output, in
which <br>
case <b>pamcomp</b> does not truncate it. Note that
<b>pamcomp</b> is <br>
unusual among Netpbm programs, as a historical accident, in
having an output <br>
file argument; Netpbm programs normally write to Standard
Output only.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most
notably <b>-quiet</b>, see
<a href="index.html#commonoptions"> Common Options</a> ),
<b>pamcomp</b> recognizes the following command line
options: <b><br>
-align=</b><i>alignment</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option selects the basic
horizontal position of the overlay image with respect to the
underlying image, in syntax reminiscent of HTML. <b>left</b>
means flush left, <b>center</b> means centered, and
<b>right</b> means flush right.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-xoff</b> option modifies this position.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>beyondleft</b>
means just out of frame to the left -- the right edge of the
overlay is flush with the left edge of the underlying image.
<b>beyondright</b> means just out of frame to the right.
These alignments are useful only if you add a <b>-xoff</b>
option. These two values were added in Netpbm 10.10 (October
2002).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default is
<b>left</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-valign=</b><i>alignment</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option selects the basic
vertical position of the overlay image with respect to the
underlying image, in syntax reminiscent of HTML. <b>top</b>
means flush top, <b>middle</b> means centered, and
<b>bottom</b> means flush bottom.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>-yoff</b> option modifies this position.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>above</b>
means just out of frame to the top -- the bottom edge of the
overlay is flush with the top edge of the underlying image.
<b>below</b> means just out of frame to the bottom. These
alignments are useful only if you add a <b>-yoff</b> option.
These two values were added in Netpbm 10.10 (October
2002).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The default is
<b>top</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-xoff=</b><i>x</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option modifies the
horizontal positioning of the overlay image with respect to
the underlying image as selected by the <b>-align</b>
option. <b>pamcomp</b> shifts the overlay image from that
basic position <i>x</i> pixels to the right. <i>x</i> can be
negative to indicate shifting to the left.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The overlay
need not fit entirely (or at all) on the underlying image.
<b>pamcomp</b> uses only the parts that lie over the
underlying image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.10 (October 2002), <b>-xoff</b> was mutually exclusive
with <b>-align</b> and always measured from the left
edge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-yoff=</b><i>y</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option modifies the
vertical positioning of the overlay image with respect to
the underlying image as selected by the <b>-valign</b>
option. <b>pamcomp</b> shifts the overlay image from that
basic position <i>y</i> pixels downward. <i>y</i> can be
negative to indicate shifting upward.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The overlay
need not fit entirely (or at all) on the underlying image.
<b>pamcomp</b> uses only the parts that lie over the
underlying image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Before Netpbm
10.10 (October 2002), <b>-xoff</b> was mutually exclusive
with <b>-valign</b> and always measured from the top
edge.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-alpha=</b><i>alpha-pgmfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option names a file that
contains the transparency mask. If you don&rsquo;t specify
this option, there is no transparency mask, which is
equivalent to having a transparency mask specify total
opaqueness everywhere.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">You can specify
<b>-</b> as the value of this option and the transparency
mask will come from Standard Input. If you do this,
don&rsquo;t specify Standard Input as the source of any
other input image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-invert</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option inverts the sense
of the values in the transparency mask, which effectively
switches the roles of the overlay image and the underlying
image in places where the two intersect.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-opacity=</b><i>opacity</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option tells how opaque
the overlay image is to be, i.e. how much of the composite
image should be from the overlay image, as opposed to the
underlying image. <i>opacity</i> is a floating point number,
with 1.0 meaning the overlay image is totally opaque and 0.0
meaning it is totally transparent. The default is 1.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
a transparency mask (the <b>-alpha</b> option),
<b>pamcomp</b> uses the product of the opacity indicated by
the transparency mask (as modified by the <b>-invert</b>
option, as a fraction, and this opacity value. The
<b>-invert</b> option does not apply to this opacity
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">As a simple
opacity value, the value makes sense only if it is between 0
and 1, inclusive. However, <b>pamcomp</b> accepts all values
and performs the same arithmetic computation using whatever
value you provide. An opacity value less than zero means the
underlay image is intensified and then the overlay image is
&quot;subtracted&quot; from it. An opacity value greater
than unity means the overlay image is intensified and the
underlay image subtracted from it. In either case,
<b>pamcomp</b> clips the resulting color component
intensities so they are nonnegative and don&rsquo;t exceed
the output image&rsquo;s maxval.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This may seem
like a strange thing to do, but it has uses. You can use it
to brighten or darken or saturate or desaturate areas of the
underlay image. See <b>this description</b>(1) of the
technique.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option was
added in Netpbm 10.6 (July 2002). Before Netpbm 10.15 (April
2003), values less than zero or greater than unity were not
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-mixtransparency</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option controls what
<b>pamcomp</b> does where both the underlying and overlay
image are non-opaque.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
output image has the same transparency as the underlying
image and the transparency of the underlying image has no
effect on the composition of color.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">But with this
option, <b>pamcomp</b> composes the image according to a
plastic transparency metaphor: the underlying and overlay
images are plastic slides. The output image is the slide you
get when you stack up those two slides. So the transparency
of the output is a combination of the transparency of the
inputs and the transparency of the underlying image affects
the underlying image&rsquo;s contribution to the output
image&rsquo;s color.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike the
metaphorical slide, a PAM pixel has a color even where it is
completely transparent, so <b>pamcomp</b> departs from the
metaphor in that case and makes the output color identical
to the underlying image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option was
new in Netpbm 10.56 (September 2011). Before that, the
output is always opaque and the <b>pamcomp</b> ignores the
transparency of the underlying image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-linear</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option indicates that the
inputs are not true Netpbm images but rather a
light-intesity-proportional variation. This is relevant only
when you mix pixels, using the <b>-opacity</b> option or a
transparency mask (the <b>-alpha</b> option).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The
transparency mask and <b>-opacity</b> values indicate a
fraction of the light intensity of a pixel. But the PNM and
PNM-equivalent PAM image formats represent intensities with
gamma-adjusted numbers that are not linearly proportional to
intensity. So <b>pamcomp</b>, by default, performs a
calculation on each sample read from its input and each
sample written to its output to convert between these
gamma-adjusted numbers and internal intensity-proportional
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes you
are not working with true PNM or PAM images, but rather a
variation in which the sample values are in fact directly
proportional to intensity. If so, use the <b>-linear</b>
option to tell <b>pamcomp</b> this. <b>pamcomp</b> then will
skip the conversions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The conversion
takes time. And the difference between
intensity-proportional values and gamma-adjusted values may
be small enough that you would barely see a difference in
the result if you just pretended that the gamma-adjusted
values were in fact intensity-proportional. So just to save
time, at the expense of some image quality, you can specify
<b>-linear</b> even when you have true PPM input and expect
true PPM output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For the first
13 years of Netpbm&rsquo;s life, until Netpbm 10.20 (January
2004), <b>pamcomp</b>&rsquo;s predecessor <b>pnmcomp</b>
always treated the PPM samples as intensity-proportional
even though they were not, and drew few complaints. So using
<b>-linear</b> as a lie is a reasonable thing to do if speed
is important to you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Another
technique to consider is to convert your PNM image to the
linear variation with <b>pnmgamma</b>, run <b>pamcomp</b> on
it and other transformations that like linear PNM, and then
convert it back to true PNM with <b>pnmgamma -ungamma</b>.
<b>pnmgamma</b> is often faster than <b>pamcomp</b> in doing
the conversion.</p>
