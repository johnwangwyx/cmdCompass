.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ====================================================================
.
.I afmtodit
creates a font file for use with
.IR groff ,
.IR grops ,
and
.IR gropdf .
.
.I afmtodit
is written in Perl;
you must have Perl version 5.004 or newer installed in order to run
.IR afmtodit .
.
.
.LP
.I afm-file
is the AFM (Adobe Font Metric) file for the font.
.
.
.LP
.I map-file
is a file that says which
.I groff
character names map onto each PostScript character name;
this file should contain a sequence of lines of the form
.
.RS
.I
ps-char groff-char
.RE
.
where
.I ps-char
is the PostScript name of the character and
.I groff-char
is the groff name of the character (as used in the
.I groff
font file).
.
The same
.I ps-char
can occur multiple times in the file;
each
.I groff-char
must occur at most once.
.
Lines starting with \(oq#\(cq and blank lines are ignored.
.
If the file isn't found in the current directory,
it is searched for in the
.I devps/generate
subdirectory of the default font directory.
.
.
.LP
If a PostScript character is not mentioned in
.IR map-file ,
and a generic
.I groff
glyph name can't be deduced using the Adobe Glyph List
(AGL, built into
.IR afmtodit ),
then
.I afmtodit
puts the PostScript character into the
.I groff
font file as an unnamed character which can only be accessed by the
\(oq\eN\(cq escape sequence in a
.I roff
document.
.
In particular,
this is true for glyph variants named in the form \(lqfoo.bar\(rq;
all glyph names containing one or more periods are mapped to unnamed
entities.
.
If option
.B \-e
is not specified, the encoding defined in the AFM file (i.e., entries
with non-negative character codes) is used.
.
Refer to section \(lqUsing Symbols\(rq in
.IR "Groff: The GNU Implementation of troff" ,
the
.I groff
Texinfo manual,
which describes how
.I groff
glyph names are constructed.
.
.
.LP
Characters not encoded in the AFM file (i.e., entries which have
\(oq\-1\(cq as the character code) are still available in
.IR groff ;
they get glyph index values greater than 255 (or greater than the
biggest character code used in the AFM file in the unlikely case that it
is greater than 255) in the
.I groff
font file.
.
Glyph indices of unencoded characters don't have a specific order;
it is best to access them with glyph names only.
.
.
.LP
The
.I groff
font file will be output to a file called
.IR font ,
unless the
.B \-o
option is used.
.
.
.LP
If there is a downloadable font file for the font, it may be listed in
the file
.IR d:/\:usr/\:share/\:groff/\:1.22.4/\:font/\:devps/\:download ;
see
.IR grops (1).
.
.
.LP
If the
.B \-i
option is used,
.I afmtodit
will automatically generate an italic correction,
a left italic correction and a subscript correction
for each character
(the significance of these parameters is explained in
.IR groff_font (5));
these parameters may be specified for individual characters by
adding to the
.I afm-file
lines of the form:
.
.RS
.EX
.BI italicCorrection \~ps-char\~n
.BI leftItalicCorrection \~ps-char\~n
.BI subscriptCorrection \~ps-char\~n
.EE
.RE
.
where
.I ps-char
is the PostScript name of the character,
and
.I n
is the desired value of the corresponding parameter in thousandths of an
em.
.
These parameters are normally needed only for italic (or oblique) fonts.
.
.
.\" ====================================================================
.SH OPTIONS
.\" ====================================================================
.
Whitespace is permitted between a command-line option and its argument.
.
.
.TP
.BI \-a n
Use
.I n
as the slant parameter in the font file;
this is used by
.I groff
in the positioning of accents.
.
By default
.I afmtodit
uses the negative of the
.B ItalicAngle
specified in the AFM file;
with true italic fonts it is sometimes desirable to use a slant that is
less than this.
.
If you find that characters from an italic font have accents placed too
far to the right over them,
then use the
.B \-a
option to give the font a smaller slant.
.
.
.TP
.B \-c
Include comments in the font file in order to identify the PostScript
font.
.
.
.TP
.BI \-d desc-file
The device description file is
.I desc-file
rather than the default
.IR DESC .
.
If not found in the current directory,
the
.I devps
subdirectory of the default font directory is searched (this is true for
both the default device description file and a file given with option
.BR \-d ).
.
.
.TP
.BI \-e enc-file
The PostScript font should be reencoded to use the encoding described
in
.IR enc-file .
.
The format of
.I enc-file
is described in
.IR grops (1).
.
If not found in the current directory,
the
.I devps
subdirectory of the default font directory is searched.
.
.
.TP
.BI \-f name
The internal name of the
.I groff
font is set to
.IR name .
.
.
.TP
.BI \-i n
Generate an italic correction for each character so that the
character's width plus the character's italic correction is equal to
.I n
thousandths of an em
plus the amount by which the right edge of the character's bounding box
is to the right of the character's origin.
.
If this would result in a negative italic correction, use a zero
italic correction instead.
.
.
.IP
Also generate a subscript correction equal to the
product of the tangent of the slant of the font and
four fifths of the x-height of the font.
.
If this would result in a subscript correction greater than the italic
correction, use a subscript correction equal to the italic correction
instead.
.
.
.IP
Also generate a left italic correction for each character
equal to
.I n
thousandths of an em
plus the amount by which the left edge of the character's bounding box
is to the left of the character's origin.
.
The left italic correction may be negative unless option
.B \-m
is given.
.
.
.IP
This option is normally needed only with italic (or oblique) fonts.
.
The font files distributed with
.I groff
were created using an option of
.B \-i50
for italic fonts.
.
.
.TP
.BI \-o output-file
The output file is
.I output-file
instead of
.IR font .
.
.
.TP
.B \-k
Omit any kerning data from the
.I groff
font;
use only for monospaced (constant-width) fonts.
.
.
.TP
.B \-m
Prevent negative left italic correction values.
.
Roman font files distributed with
.I groff
were created with
.B \-i0\ \-m
to improve spacing with
.IR eqn (1).
.
.
.TP
.B \-n
Don't output a
.B ligatures
command for this font;
use with monospaced (constant-width) fonts.
.
.
.TP
.B \-s
The font is special.
.
The effect of this option is to add the
.B special
command to the font file.
.
.
.TP
.B \-v
Print version and exit.
.
.
.TP
.B \-x
Don't use the built-in Adobe Glyph List.
