DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This  document  describes the ggrrooffff program, the main front-end for the
       _g_r_o_f_f document formatting system.  The _g_r_o_f_f program and macro suite is
       the implementation of a rrooffff(7) system within the free software collec-
       tion GNU <http://www.gnu.org>.  The _g_r_o_f_f system has  all  features  of
       the classical _r_o_f_f, but adds many extensions.

       The  ggrrooffff program allows control of the whole _g_r_o_f_f system by command-
       line options.  This is a great  simplification  in  comparison  to  the
       classical case (which uses pipes only).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The  command  line  is  parsed  according  to the usual GNU convention.
       Whitespace is permitted between a command-line option and its argument.
       Options  can be grouped behind a single `-' (minus character).  A file-
       name of -- (minus character) denotes the standard input.

       As ggrrooffff is a wrapper program for ttrrooffff both programs share  a  set  of
       options.  But the ggrrooffff program has some additional, native options and
       gives a new meaning to some ttrrooffff options.  On the other hand, not  all
       ttrrooffff options can be fed into ggrrooffff.

   NNaattiivvee ggrrooffff OOppttiioonnss
       The  following options either do not exist for ttrrooffff or are differently
       interpreted by ggrrooffff.

       --DD _a_r_g Set default input encoding used by pprreeccoonnvv to _a_r_g.  Implies --kk.

       --ee     Preprocess with eeqqnn.

       --gg     Preprocess with ggrrnn.

       --GG     Preprocess with ggrraapp.  Implies --pp.

       --hh
       ----hheellpp Print a help message.

       --II _d_i_r This option may be used to specify a  directory  to  search  for
              files  (both  those on the command line and those named in ..ppssbbbb
              and ..ssoo requests, and \\XX''ppss:: iimmppoorrtt'' , \\XX''ppss:: ffiillee'' and  \\XX''ppddff::
              ppddffppiicc''  escapes).   The  current  directory  is always searched
              first.  This option may be specified more than once; the  direc-
              tories are searched in the order specified.  No directory search
              is performed for files specified using an absolute  path.   This
              option implies the --ss option.

       --jj     Preprocess with cchheemm.  Implies --pp.

       --kk     Preprocess  with  pprreeccoonnvv.   This  is  run before any other pre-
              processor.  Please refer to pprreeccoonnvv's manual page for its behav-
              iour if no --KK (or --DD) option is specified.

       --KK _a_r_g Set input encoding used by pprreeccoonnvv to _a_r_g.  Implies --kk.

       --ll     Send  the output to a spooler program for printing.  The command
              that should be used for this is specified by the  pprriinntt  command
              in the device description file, see ggrrooffff__ffoonntt(5).  If this com-
              mand is not present, the output is piped into the llpprr(1) program
              by default.  See options --LL and --XX.

       --LL _a_r_g Pass  _a_r_g  to  the spooler program.  Several arguments should be
              passed with a separate -L option each.  Note that ggrrooffff does not
              prepend  `-'  (a  minus  sign)  to  _a_r_g before passing it to the
              spooler program.

       --NN     Don't allow newlines within _e_q_n delimiters.  This is the same as
              the --NN option in eeqqnn.

       --pp     Preprocess with ppiicc.

       --PP _-_o_p_t_i_o_n
       --PP _-_o_p_t_i_o_n --PP _a_r_g
              Pass  _-_o_p_t_i_o_n  or  _-_o_p_t_i_o_n _a_r_g to the postprocessor.  The option
              must be specified with the necessary preceding minus sign(s) `-'
              or `--' because ggrrooffff does not prepend any dashes before passing
              it to the postprocessor.  For example, to pass a  title  to  the
              ggxxddiittvviieeww postprocessor, the shell command

                     groff -X -P -title -P 'groff it' _f_o_o

              is equivalent to

                     groff -X -Z _f_o_o | gxditview -title 'groff it' -

       --RR     Preprocess  with  rreeffeerr.   No  mechanism is provided for passing
              arguments to rreeffeerr because most rreeffeerr  options  have  equivalent
              language  elements  that  can  be specified within the document.
              See rreeffeerr(1) for more details.

       --ss     Preprocess with ssooeelliimm.

       --SS     Safer mode.  Pass the --SS option to ppiicc and disable the following
              ttrrooffff requests: ..ooppeenn, ..ooppeennaa, ..ppssoo, ..ssyy, and ..ppii.  For security
              reasons, safer mode is enabled by default.

       --tt     Preprocess with ttbbll.

       --TT _d_e_v Set output device to _d_e_v.  For this device, ttrrooffff generates  the
              _i_n_t_e_r_m_e_d_i_a_t_e _o_u_t_p_u_t; see ggrrooffff__oouutt(5).  Then ggrrooffff calls a post-
              processor to convert ttrrooffff's _i_n_t_e_r_m_e_d_i_a_t_e _o_u_t_p_u_t  to  its  final
              format.  Real devices in ggrrooffff are

                     dvi    TeX DVI format (postprocessor is ggrrooddvvii).

                     html
                     xhtml  HTML  and  XHTML  output (preprocessors are ssooeelliimm
                            and pprree--ggrroohhttmmll, postprocessor is ppoosstt--ggrroohhttmmll).

                     lbp    Canon CAPSL printers (LBP-4 and LBP-8 series laser
                            printers; postprocessor is ggrroollbbpp).

                     lj4    HP LaserJet4 compatible (or other PCL5 compatible)
                            printers (postprocessor is ggrroolljj44).

                     ps     PostScript output (postprocessor is ggrrooppss).

                     pdf    Portable Document Format (PDF) output (postproces-
                            sor is ggrrooppddff).

              For  the  following  TTY output devices (postprocessor is always
              ggrroottttyy), --TT selects the output encoding:

                     ascii  7bit ASCII.

                     cp1047 Latin-1 character set for EBCDIC hosts.

                     latin1 ISO 8859-1.

                     utf8   Unicode character set  in  UTF-8  encoding.   This
                            mode has the most useful fonts for TTY mode, so it
                            is the best mode for TTY output.

              The following arguments select ggxxddiittvviieeww as the  `postprocessor'
              (it is rather a viewing program):

                     X75    75dpi resolution, 10pt document base font.

                     X75-12 75dpi resolution, 12pt document base font.

                     X100   100dpi resolution, 10pt document base font.

                     X100-12
                            100dpi resolution, 12pt document base font.

              The default device is ppss.

       --UU     Unsafe  mode.  Reverts to the (old) unsafe behaviour; see option
              --SS.

       --vv
       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Output version information of ggrrooffff and of all programs that are
              run  by  it;  that  is,  the given command line is parsed in the
              usual way, passing --vv to all subprograms.

       --VV     Output the pipeline that would be run by  ggrrooffff  (as  a  wrapper
              program)  on  the  standard  output,  but do not execute it.  If
              given more than once, the commands are both printed on the stan-
              dard error and run.

       --XX     Use  ggxxddiittvviieeww  instead  of  using  the  usual  postprocessor to
              (pre)view a document.  The printing spooler behavior as outlined
              with options --ll and --LL is carried over to ggxxddiittvviieeww(1) by deter-
              mining an argument for the --pprriinnttCCoommmmaanndd option of ggxxddiittvviieeww(1).
              This  sets  the  default PPrriinntt action and the corresponding menu
              entry to that value.  --XX only produces good results  with  --TTppss,
              --TTXX7755,  --TTXX7755--1122, --TTXX110000, and --TTXX110000--1122.  The default resolution
              for previewing --TTppss output is 75dpi;  this  can  be  changed  by
              passing the --rreessoolluuttiioonn option to ggxxddiittvviieeww, for example

                     groff -X -P-resolution -P100 -man foo.1

       --zz     Suppress  output  generated  by  ttrrooffff.  Only error messages are
              printed.

       --ZZ     Do not automatically postprocess _g_r_o_f_f  _i_n_t_e_r_m_e_d_i_a_t_e  _o_u_t_p_u_t  in
              the usual manner.  This will cause the ttrrooffff _o_u_t_p_u_t to appear on
              standard output, replacing the usual postprocessor  output;  see
              ggrrooffff__oouutt(5).

   TTrraannssppaarreenntt OOppttiioonnss
       The  following  options  are transparently handed over to the formatter
       program ttrrooffff that is called by ggrrooffff subsequently.  These options  are
       described in more detail in ttrrooffff(1).

       --aa     ASCII approximation of output.

       --bb     Backtrace on error or warning.

UUSSIINNGG GGRROOFFFF
       The  _g_r_o_f_f  _s_y_s_t_e_m implements the infrastructure of classical roff; see
       rrooffff(7) for a survey on how a _r_o_f_f system works in general.  Due to the
       front-end  programs  available  within the _g_r_o_f_f system, using _g_r_o_f_f is
       much easier than _c_l_a_s_s_i_c_a_l _r_o_f_f.  This section gives an overview of the
       parts  that  constitute  the _g_r_o_f_f system.  It complements rrooffff(7) with
       _g_r_o_f_f-specific features.  This section can be regarded as  a  guide  to
       the documentation around the _g_r_o_f_f system.

   PPaappeerr SSiizzee
       The  _v_i_r_t_u_a_l paper size used by ttrrooffff to format the input is controlled
       globally with the requests ..ppoo, ..ppll, and ..llll.   See  ggrrooffff__ttmmaacc(5)  for
       the `papersize' macro package which provides a convenient interface.

       The  _p_h_y_s_i_c_a_l  paper  size,  giving  the actual dimensions of the paper
       sheets, is controlled by output devices like ggrrooppss  with  the  command-
       line  options  --pp  and  --ll.  See ggrrooffff__ffoonntt(5) and the man pages of the
       output devices for more details.  ggrrooffff uses the command-line option --PP
       to  pass  options to output devices; for example, the following selects
       A4 paper in landscape orientation for the PS device:

              groff -Tps -P-pa4 -P-l ...

   FFrroonntt--eennddss
       The ggrrooffff program is a wrapper around the ttrrooffff(1) program.  It  allows
       one  to specify the preprocessors by command-line options and automati-
       cally runs the postprocessor  that  is  appropriate  for  the  selected
       device.   Doing so, the sometimes tedious piping mechanism of classical
       rrooffff(7) can be avoided.

       The ggrroogg(1) program can be used for guessing the correct _g_r_o_f_f  command
       line to format a file.

       The  ggrrooffffeerr(1) program is an all-around viewer for _g_r_o_f_f files and man
       pages.

       The _g_r_o_f_f preprocessors are reimplementations  of  the  classical  pre-
       processors  with  moderate extensions.  The standard preprocessors dis-
       tributed with the _g_r_o_f_f package are

       eeqqnn(1) for mathematical formulae,

       ggrrnn(1) for including ggrreemmlliinn(1) pictures,

       ppiicc(1) for drawing diagrams,

       cchheemm(1)
              for chemical structure diagrams,

       rreeffeerr(1)
              for bibliographic references,

       ssooeelliimm(1)
              for including macro files from standard locations,

       and

       ttbbll(1) for tables.

       A new preprocessor not available in classical _t_r_o_f_f is pprreeccoonnvv(1) which
       converts various input encodings to something ggrrooffff can understand.  It
       is always run first before any other preprocessor.

       Besides these, there are some internal preprocessors that are automati-
       cally run with some devices.  These aren't visible to the user.

       Macro  packages  can be included by option --mm.  The _g_r_o_f_f system imple-
       ments and extends all classical macro packages in a compatible way  and
       adds  some packages of its own.  Actually, the following macro packages
       come with _g_r_o_f_f:

       mmaann    The traditional man page format; see ggrrooffff__mmaann(7).   It  can  be
              specified on the command line as --mmaann or --mm mmaann.

       mmaannddoocc The  general  package for man pages; it automatically recognizes
              whether the documents uses  the  _m_a_n  or  the  _m_d_o_c  format  and
              branches  to  the corresponding macro package.  It can be speci-
              fied on the command line as --mmaannddoocc or --mm mmaannddoocc.

       mmddoocc   The BSD-style man page format; see  ggrrooffff__mmddoocc(7).   It  can  be
              specified on the command line as --mmddoocc or --mm mmddoocc.

       mmee     The  classical  _m_e  document format; see ggrrooffff__mmee(7).  It can be
              specified on the command line as --mmee or --mm mmee.

       mmmm     The classical _m_m document format; see ggrrooffff__mmmm(7).   It  can  be
              specified on the command line as --mmmm or --mm mmmm.

       mmss     The  classical  _m_s  document format; see ggrrooffff__mmss(7).  It can be
              specified on the command line as --mmss or --mm mmss.

       wwwwww    HTML-like macros for inclusion in arbitrary _g_r_o_f_f documents; see
              ggrrooffff__wwwwww(7).

       Details  on  the naming of macro files and their placement can be found
       in ggrrooffff__ttmmaacc(5); this man page also documents some other, minor auxil-
       iary macro packages not mentioned here.

       General concepts common to all _r_o_f_f programming languages are described
       in rrooffff(7).

       The _g_r_o_f_f extensions to the classical _t_r_o_f_f language are documented  in
       ggrrooffff__ddiiffff(7).

       An  overview  of language features, including all supported escapes and
       requests, can be found in ggrrooffff(7).

   FFoorrmmaatttteerrss
       The central _r_o_f_f formatter within the _g_r_o_f_f  system  is  ttrrooffff(1).   It
       provides the features of both the classical _t_r_o_f_f and _n_r_o_f_f, as well as
       the _g_r_o_f_f extensions.  The command-line option --CC switches  ttrrooffff  into
       _c_o_m_p_a_t_i_b_i_l_i_t_y  _m_o_d_e  which  tries  to emulate classical _r_o_f_f as much as
       possible.

       There is a shell script nnrrooffff(1) that emulates the behavior of  classi-
       cal  nnrrooffff.   It tries to automatically select the proper output encod-
       ing, according to the current locale.

       The formatter program generates _i_n_t_e_r_m_e_d_i_a_t_e _o_u_t_p_u_t; see ggrrooffff__oouutt(7).

   DDeevviicceess
       In _r_o_f_f, the output targets are called _d_e_v_i_c_e_s.   A  device  can  be  a
       piece  of  hardware,  e.g.,  a  printer,  or a software file format.  A
       device is specified by the option --TT.  The _g_r_o_f_f devices  are  as  fol-
       lows.

              base font is XX7755--1122.

       XX110000   100dpi  X  Window  System  output  suitable  for  the previewers
              xxddiittvviieeww(1x) and ggxxddiittvviieeww(1).  A variant for  a  12pt  document
              base font is XX110000--1122.

       The  postprocessor  to be used for a device is specified by the ppoossttpprroo
       command in the device description file; see ggrrooffff__ffoonntt(5).  This can be
       overridden with the --XX option.

       The default device is ppss.

   PPoossttpprroocceessssoorrss
       _g_r_o_f_f provides 3 hardware postprocessors:

       ggrroollbbpp(1)
              for some Canon printers,

       ggrroolljj44(1)
              for printers compatible to the HP LaserJet 4 and PCL5,

       ggrroottttyy(1)
              for  text output using various encodings, e.g., on text-oriented
              terminals or line printers.

       Today, most printing or drawing hardware is handled  by  the  operating
       system, by device drivers, or by software interfaces, usually accepting
       PostScript.  Consequently, there isn't an urgent need for more hardware
       device postprocessors.

       The _g_r_o_f_f software devices for conversion into other document file for-
       mats are

       ggrrooddvvii(1)
              for the DVI format,

       ggrroohhttmmll(1)
              for HTML and XHTML formats,

       ggrrooppss(1)
              for PostScript.

       ggrrooppddff(1)
              for PDF.

       Combined with the many existing free conversion tools  this  should  be
       sufficient to convert a _t_r_o_f_f document into virtually any existing data
       format.

   UUttiilliittiieess
       The following utility programs around _g_r_o_f_f are available.

       Normally,  the path separator in the following environment variables is
       the colon; this may vary depending on the operating system.  For  exam-
       ple, DOS and Windows use a semicolon instead.

       _G_R_O_F_F___B_I_N___P_A_T_H
              This  search  path,  followed by _P_A_T_H, is used for commands that
              are executed by ggrrooffff.  If it is  not  set  then  the  directory
              where the _g_r_o_f_f binaries were installed is prepended to _P_A_T_H.

       _G_R_O_F_F___C_O_M_M_A_N_D___P_R_E_F_I_X
              When  there  is  a need to run different _r_o_f_f implementations at
              the same time _g_r_o_f_f provides the facility to prepend a prefix to
              most  of  its  programs that could provoke name clashings at run
              time (default is to have none).  Historically, this  prefix  was
              the  character  gg,  but it can be anything.  For example, ggttrrooffff
              stood for _g_r_o_f_f's ttrrooffff, ggttbbll for the _g_r_o_f_f version of ttbbll.   By
              setting  _G_R_O_F_F___C_O_M_M_A_N_D___P_R_E_F_I_X to different values, the different
              _r_o_f_f installations can be addressed.  More exactly, if it is set
              to  prefix  _x_x_x then ggrrooffff as a wrapper program internally calls
              _x_x_xttrrooffff instead of ttrrooffff.  This also applies to the  preproces-
              sors  eeqqnn,  ggrrnn,  ppiicc,  rreeffeerr, ttbbll, ssooeelliimm, and to the utilities
              iinnddxxbbiibb and llooookkbbiibb.  This feature does not apply  to  any  pro-
              grams  different from the ones above (most notably ggrrooffff itself)
              since they are unique to the _g_r_o_f_f package.

       _G_R_O_F_F___E_N_C_O_D_I_N_G
              The value of this environment value is  passed  to  the  pprreeccoonnvv
              preprocessor  to  select  the  encoding of input files.  Setting
              this option implies ggrrooffff's command-line  option  --kk  (this  is,
              ggrrooffff  actually  always calls pprreeccoonnvv).  If set without a value,
              ggrrooffff calls pprreeccoonnvv without arguments.  An explicit --KK  command-
              line  option  overrides  the  value of _G_R_O_F_F___E_N_C_O_D_I_N_G.  See pprree--
              ccoonnvv(1) for details.

       _G_R_O_F_F___F_O_N_T___P_A_T_H
              A list of directories in which to search for the _d_e_vname  direc-
              tory  in  addition  to  the  default  ones.   See  ttrrooffff(1)  and
              ggrrooffff__ffoonntt(5) for more details.

       _G_R_O_F_F___T_M_A_C___P_A_T_H
              A list of directories in which to  search  for  macro  files  in
              addition   to   the   default  directories.   See  ttrrooffff(1)  and
              ggrrooffff__ttmmaacc(5) for more details.

       _G_R_O_F_F___T_M_P_D_I_R
              The directory in which temporary files are created.  If this  is
              not  set  but the environment variable _T_M_P_D_I_R instead, temporary
              files are created in the directory _T_M_P_D_I_R.  On MS-DOS  and  Win-
              dows  platforms, the environment variables _T_M_P and _T_E_M_P (in that
              order) are searched also, after _G_R_O_F_F___T_M_P_D_I_R and _T_M_P_D_I_R.  Other-
              wise,  temporary  files  are  created  in  _/_t_m_p.   The rreeffeerr(1),
              ggrrooffffeerr(1), ggrroohhttmmll(1),  and  ggrrooppss(1)  commands  use  temporary
              files.

       _G_R_O_F_F___T_Y_P_E_S_E_T_T_E_R
              Preset  the default device.  If this is not set the ppss device is
              used as default.  This device name is overwritten by the  option
              --TT.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       The  following  example illustrates the power of the ggrrooffff program as a
       wrapper around ttrrooffff.

       To process a _r_o_f_f file using the preprocessors ttbbll and ppiicc and  the  mmee
       macro set, classical _t_r_o_f_f had to be called by

              pic foo.me | tbl | troff -me -Tlatin1 | grotty

       Using ggrrooffff, this pipe can be shortened to the equivalent command

              groff -p -t -me -T latin1 foo.me

       An  even  easier  way  to call this is to use ggrroogg(1) to guess the pre-
       processor and macro options and execute the generated command (by using
       backquotes to specify shell command substitution)

              `grog -Tlatin1 foo.me`

       The simplest way is to view the contents in an automated way by calling

              groffer foo.me

       Lemberg, is the primary _g_r_o_f_f manual.  You can browse it  interactively
       with "info groff".

       Due  to  its  complex  structure,  the _g_r_o_f_f system has many man pages.
       They can be read with mmaann(1) or ggrrooffffeerr(1).

       But there are special sections of _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s.  _g_r_o_f_f has  man  pages  in
       sections  11,  55,aanndd  7..  When there are several _m_a_n _p_a_g_e_s with the same
       name in the same _m_a_n section, the one with the lowest section is should
       as  first.   The other man pages can be shown anyway by adding the sec-
       tion number as argument before the man page name.  Reading the man page
       about the _g_r_o_f_f language is done by one of
