DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       pprreeccoonnvv reads _f_i_l_e_s and converts its encoding(s) to a form GNU ttrrooffff(1)
       can  process,  sending  the  data  to standard output.  Currently, this
       means ASCII characters and `\[uXXXX]' entities, where `XXXX' is a hexa-
       decimal  number  with  four to six digits, representing a Unicode input
       code.  Normally, pprreeccoonnvv should be invoked with the --kk and  --KK  options
       of ggrrooffff.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Whitespace is permitted between a command-line option and its argument.

       --dd     Emit  debugging  messages  to  standard  error  (mainly the used
              encoding).

       --DD_e_n_c_o_d_i_n_g
              Specify default encoding if everything fails (see below).

       --ee_e_n_c_o_d_i_n_g
              Specify input encoding explicitly, overriding all other methods.
              This  corresponds  to  ggrrooffff's  --KK_e_n_c_o_d_i_n_g option.  Without this
              switch, pprreeccoonnvv uses the algorithm described below to select the
              input encoding.

       ----hheellpp
       --hh     Print a help message and exit.

       --rr     Do not add .lf requests.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
       --vv     Print the version number and exit.

UUSSAAGGEE
       pprreeccoonnvv tries to find the input encoding with the following algorithm.

       1.     If  the input encoding has been explicitly specified with option
              --ee, use it.

       2.     Otherwise, check whether the input starts with a _B_y_t_e _O_r_d_e_r _M_a_r_k
              (BOM, see below).  If found, use it.

       3.     Otherwise, check whether there is a known _c_o_d_i_n_g _t_a_g (see below)
              in either the first or second input line.  If found, use it.

       4      Finally, if the uucchhaarrddeett library (an encoding  detector  library
              available  on most major distributions) is available on the sys-
              tem, use it to try to detect the encoding of the file.

       5.     If everything fails, use a default encoding as given with option
              --DD,  by  the current locale, or `latin1' if the locale is set to
              `C', `POSIX', or empty (in that order).

       Note that the ggrrooffff program supports a _G_R_O_F_F___E_N_C_O_D_I_N_G environment vari-
       able which is eventually expanded to option --kk.

   BByyttee OOrrddeerr MMaarrkk
       The  Unicode  Standard  defines character U+FEFF as the Byte Order Mark
       (BOM).  On the other hand, value U+FFFE is guaranteed not be a  Unicode
       character  at  all.  This allows detection of the byte order within the
       data stream (either big-endian or little-endian), and the  MIME  encod-
       ings  `UTF-16'  and  `UTF-32'  mandate that the data stream starts with
       U+FEFF.  Similarly, the data stream encoded as `UTF-8' might start with
       a  BOM  (to ease the conversion from and to UTF-16 and UTF-32).  In all
       cases, the byte order mark is _n_o_t part of the  data  but  part  of  the
       encoding protocol; in other words, pprreeccoonnvv's output doesn't contain it.

       Note  that  U+FEFF not at the start of the input data actually is emit-
       ted; it has then the meaning of a `zero width no-break space' character
       - something not needed normally in ggrrooffff.

   CCooddiinngg TTaaggss
       Editors  which  support more than a single character encoding need tags
       within the input files to mark the file's encoding.  While it is possi-
       ble  to guess the right input encoding with the help of heuristic algo-
       rithms for data which represents a greater amount  of  a  natural  lan-
       guage,  it  is  still  just a guess.  Additionally, all algorithms fail
       easily for input which is either too short or doesn't represent a natu-
       ral language.

       For  these  reasons,  pprreeccoonnvv  supports the coding tag convention (with
       some restrictions) as used by GGNNUU EEmmaaccss and XXEEmmaaccss (and probably  other
       programs too).

       Coding  tags in GGNNUU EEmmaaccss and XXEEmmaaccss are stored in so-called _F_i_l_e _V_a_r_i_-
       _a_b_l_e_s.  pprreeccoonnvv recognizes the following syntax form which must be  put
       into a troff comment in the first or second line.

              -*- _t_a_g_1: _v_a_l_u_e_1; _t_a_g_2: _v_a_l_u_e_2; ... -*-

       The only relevant tag for pprreeccoonnvv is `coding' which can take the values
       listed below.  Here an example line which tells EEmmaaccss to edit a file in
       troff mode, and to use latin2 as its encoding.

              .\" -*- mode: troff; coding: latin-2 -*-

       The  following  list  gives  all  MIME coding tags (either lowercase or
       uppercase) supported by pprreeccoonnvv; this list is hard-coded in the source.

              big5, cp1047, euc-jp, euc-kr, gb2312, iso-8859-1, iso-8859-2,
              iso-8859-5, iso-8859-7, iso-8859-9, iso-8859-13, iso-8859-15,
              koi8-r, us-ascii, utf-8, utf-16, utf-16be, utf-16le

       In addition, the following hard-coded list of other tags is  recognized
       which eventually map to values from the list above.

              ascii, chinese-big5, chinese-euc, chinese-iso-8bit, cn-big5,
              cn-gb, cn-gb-2312, cp878, csascii, csisolatin1,
              cyrillic-iso-8bit, cyrillic-koi8, euc-china, euc-cn, euc-japan,
              euc-japan-1990, euc-korea, greek-iso-8bit, iso-10646/utf8,
              iso-10646/utf-8, iso-latin-1, iso-latin-2, iso-latin-5,
              iso-latin-7, iso-latin-9, japanese-euc, japanese-iso-8bit, jis8,
              koi8, korean-euc, korean-iso-8bit, latin-0, latin1, latin-1,
              latin-2, latin-5, latin-7, latin-9, mule-utf-8, mule-utf-16,
              mule-utf-16be, mule-utf-16-be, mule-utf-16be-with-signature,
              mule-utf-16le, mule-utf-16-le, mule-utf-16le-with-signature,
              utf8, utf-16-be, utf-16-be-with-signature,
              utf-16be-with-signature, utf-16-le, utf-16-le-with-signature,
              utf-16le-with-signature

       Those  tags  are  taken  from  GGNNUU EEmmaaccss and XXEEmmaaccss, together with some
       aliases.  Trailing `-dos', `-unix', and `-mac' suffixes of coding  tags
       (which  give  the end-of-line convention used in the file) are stripped
       off before the comparison with the above tags happens.

   IIccoonnvv IIssssuueess
       pprreeccoonnvv by itself only supports three encodings: latin-1,  cp1047,  and
       UTF-8;  all  other encodings are passed to the iiccoonnvv library functions.
       At compile time it is searched and checked for a valid iiccoonnvv  implemen-
       tation; a call to `preconv --version' shows whether iiccoonnvv is used.

BBUUGGSS
       pprreeccoonnvv  doesn't support _l_o_c_a_l _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e _l_i_s_t_s yet.  This is a different
       syntax form to specify local variables at the end of a file.
