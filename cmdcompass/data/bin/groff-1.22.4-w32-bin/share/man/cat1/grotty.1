DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ggrroottttyy  translates  the  output  of  GNU ttrrooffff into a form suitable for
       typewriter-like devices.  Normally ggrroottttyy should be  invoked  by  using
       the  ggrrooffff  command  with a --TTaasscciiii, --TTllaattiinn11 or --TTuuttff88 option on ASCII
       based systems, and with --TTccpp11004477 and --TTuuttff88 on EBCDIC based hosts.   If
       no  files  are given, ggrroottttyy reads the standard input.  A filename of --
       also causes ggrroottttyy to read the standard input.  Output  is  written  to
       the standard output.

       By  default,  ggrroottttyy  emits  SGR  escape sequences (from ISO 6429, also
       called ANSI color escapes) to change  text  attributes  (bold,  italic,
       colors).  This makes it possible to have eight different background and
       foreground colors; additionally, bold and italic attributes can be used
       _aa_tt _tt_hh_ee _ss_aa_mm_ee _tt_ii_mm_ee (by using the BI font).

       The following colors are defined in ttttyy..ttmmaacc: black, white, red, green,
       blue, yellow, magenta, cyan.  Unknown colors are mapped to the  default
       color  (which  is  dependent  on  the settings of the terminal; in most
       cases, this is black for the foreground and white for the background).

       Use the --cc switch to revert to the old behaviour, printing a bold char-
       acter  _c with the sequence "_c BACKSPACE _c" and an italic character _c by
       the sequence "__ BACKSPACE _c".  At the same time, color output  is  dis-
       abled.   The  same  effect  can  be  achieved  by  setting  either  the
       _G_R_O_F_F___N_O___S_G_R environment variable or using the  `sgr'  X  command  (see
       below).

       For  SGR  support,  it  is necessary to use the --RR option of lleessss(1) to
       disable the interpretation  of  ggrroottttyy's  old  output  format.   Conse-
       quently,  all programs which use lleessss as the pager program have to pass
       this option to it.  For mmaann(1) in particular,  either  add  --RR  to  the
       _P_A_G_E_R environment variable, e.g.

              PPAAGGEERR==""//uussrr//bbiinn//lleessss --RR""
              eexxppoorrtt PPAAGGEERR

       or  use  the  --PP  option  of  mmaann  to  set the pager executable and its
       options, or modify the configuration file of mmaann in a similar  fashion.
       Note that with some mmaann(1) versions, you have to use the _M_A_N_P_A_G_E_R envi-
       ronment variable instead.

       ggrroottttyy's old output format can be displayed on  a  terminal  by  piping
       through uull(1).  Pagers such as mmoorree(1) or lleessss(1) are also able to dis-
       play these sequences.  Use either --BB or --UU when  piping  into  lleessss(1);
       use --bb when piping into mmoorree(1).  There is no need to filter the output
       through ccooll(1) since ggrroottttyy never outputs reverse line feeds.

       The font description file may contain a command

              iinntteerrnnaallnnaammee _n

       where _n is a decimal integer.  If the 01 bit in _n is set, then the font
       is  treated as an italic font; if the 02 bit is set, then it is treated
       as a bold font.  The code field in the font description field gives the
       code which is used to output the character.  This code can also be used
       in the \\NN escape sequence in ttrrooffff.

       If the _D_E_S_C file contains the keyword  uunniiccooddee,  ggrroottttyy  emits  Unicode
       characters in UTF-8 encoding.  Otherwise, it emits characters in a sin-
       gle-byte encoding depending on the data in the font description  files.
       See the ggrrooffff__ffoonntt(5) man page for more details.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Whitespace is permitted between a command-line option and its argument.

       --bb     Suppress  the  use of overstriking for bold characters.  Ignored
              if --cc isn't used.

       --BB     Use only overstriking for bold-italic characters.  Ignored if --cc
              isn't used.

       --cc     Use  ggrroottttyy's old output format (see above).  This also disables
              color output.

       --dd     Ignore all \\DD commands.  Without this  ggrroottttyy  renders  \\DD''ll......''
              commands that have at least one zero argument (and so are either
              horizontal or vertical) using --, ||, and ++ characters.  In a sim-
              ilar   way,  ggrroottttyy  handles  \\DD''pp......''  commands  which  consist
              entirely of horizontal and vertical lines.

       --ff     Use form feeds in the output.  A form feed is output at the  end
              of each page that has no output on its last line.

       --FF_d_i_r  Prepend  directory  dir_/_d_e_vname  to the search path for font and
              device description files; _n_a_m_e is the name of the  device,  usu-
              ally aasscciiii, llaattiinn11, uuttff88, or ccpp11004477.

       --hh     Use  horizontal  tabs in the output.  Tabs are assumed to be set
              every 8 columns.

       --ii     Use escape sequences to set the italic text attribute instead of
              the  underline  attribute for italic fonts (`I' and `BI').  Note
              that  most  terminals  (including  xterm)  don't  support  this.
              Ignored if --cc is active.

       --oo     Suppress overstriking (other than for bold or underlined charac-
              ters in case the old output format has been activated with --cc).

       --rr     Use escape sequences to set the reverse text  attribute  instead
              of  the  underline  attribute  for  italic fonts (`I' and `BI').
              Ignored if --cc is active.

       --uu     Suppress the use of underlining for italic characters.   Ignored
              if --cc isn't used.

       --UU     Use  only underlining for bold-italic characters.  Ignored if --cc
              isn't used.

       --vv     Print the version number.

UUSSAAGGEE
       ggrroottttyy understands a single X command  produced  using  the  \\XX  escape
       sequence.

       \\XX''ttttyy:: ssggrr _n''
              If  _n  is  non-zero  or  missing, enable SGR output (this is the
              default), otherwise use the old  drawing  scheme  for  bold  and
              underline.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       _G_R_O_F_F___N_O___S_G_R
              If set, the old drawing scheme for bold and underline (using the
              backspace character) is active.  Colors are disabled.

       _G_R_O_F_F___F_O_N_T___P_A_T_H
              A list of directories in which to search for the _d_e_vname  direc-
              tory  in  addition  to  the  default  ones.   See  ttrrooffff(1)  and

BBUUGGSS
       ggrroottttyy is intended only for simple documents.

       There is no support for fractional horizontal or vertical motions.

       There  is no support for \\DD commands other than horizontal and vertical
       lines.

       Characters above the first line (i.e. with a vertical  position  of  0)
       cannot be printed.

       Color  handling  differs  from ggrrooppss(1).  \\MM doesn't set the fill color
       for closed graphic objects (which ggrroottttyy doesn't  support  anyway)  but
       changes  the background color of the character cell, affecting all sub-
       sequent operations.
