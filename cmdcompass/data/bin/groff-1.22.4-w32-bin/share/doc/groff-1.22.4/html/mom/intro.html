<h2 id="intro-intro" class="docs">Who is mom meant for?</h2>

<p>
Mom (&#8220;my own macros&#8221;, &#8220;my other macros&#8221;,
&#8220;maximum overdrive macros&#8221;...) is a macro set for groff,
designed to format documents in Portable Document Format (.pdf) and
PostScript (.ps).  She&#8217;s aimed at three kinds of users:
</p>

<ol style="margin-top: -.5em; margin-bottom: -.5em;">
  <li>Typesetters who suspect groff might be &#8220;the right
      tool for the job&#8221; but who are frustrated,
      intimidated, or puzzled by groff&#8217;s terse,
      not-always-typographically-intuitive
      <a href="definitions.html#primitives">primitives</a>;
  </li>
  <li>Writers who need to format their work easily, with a
      minimum of clutter;
  </li>
  <li>Newcomers to groff, typesetting, or document processing
      who need a well-documented macro set to get them started.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Mom is actually two macro packages in one: a very complete set
of typesetting macros, and an equally thorough set of document
formatting macros.  The typesetting macros afford fine-grained
control over all visible aspects of page layout and design (margins,
fonts, sizes, kerning, etc), while the document formatting macros
focus on the logical structure of a document (titles, headings,
paragraphs, lists, etc) and call on groff to render logical
structure into pleasing type.
</p>

<h2 id="intro-typesetting" class="docs">Typesetting with mom</h2>

<p>
Mom&#8217;s typesetting macros control the basic parameters
of type: margins, line lengths, type family, font, point size,
linespacing, and so on.  In addition, they allow you to move
around on the page horizontally and vertically, and to set up
tabs, indents, and columns.  Finally, they let you adjust such
typographic details as justification style, letter spacing, word
spacing, hyphenation, and kerning.
</p>

<p>
The typesetting macros also provide the means to create horizontal
and vertical rules, rectangles (boxes, frames), and ellipses
(circles).
</p>

<p>
In terms of typographic control, the typesetting macros provide
access to groff&#8217;s primitives in a way that&#8217;s consistent,
sensible, and easy to use.  With them, you can create individual
pages designed from the ground up.  Provided you have not signalled
to mom that you want document processing (via the
<kbd><a href="docprocessing.html#start">START</a></kbd>
macro; see below), every typesetting macro is a literal command
that remains in effect until you modify it or turn it off.  This
means that if you want to create flyers, surveys, tabulated forms,
curricula vitae and so on, you may do so in the good old-fashioned
way: one step at a time with complete control over every element on
the page.
</p>

<p>
Years of experience have convinced me that no program can ever
replace the human eye and human input when it comes to high quality
typesetting.  Words and punctuation on the printed page are too
variable, too fluid, to be rendered flawlessly by any algorithm,
no matter how clever.
</p>

<p>
Mom, therefore, does not try to guess solutions for issues like
hanging punctuation, or left-margin adjustments for troublesome
letters like T, V and W.  Rather, she provides tools that allow
knowledgeable typesetters to handle these typographic challenges in
ways that are easier and more intuitive than manipulating groff at
the primitive level.
</p>

<h2 id="intro-docprocessing" class="docs">Document processing with mom</h2>

<p>
Mom&#8217;s document processing macros let you format documents
without having to worry about the typographic details.  In this
respect, mom is similar to other groff macro packages, as well as
to html and LaTeX.  Where mom differs is in the degree of control
you have over the look and placement of the various elements of a
document.  For example, if you&#8217;d like your headings underlined,
or in caps, or centred rather than flush left, you can make the
changes easily and have them apply to the whole document.  Temporary
and one-off changes are easy, too.
</p>

<p>
Mom has some features other macro sets don&#8217;t provide.  For
example, you can switch between draft-style and final-copy output.
If you regularly make submissions to publishers and editors who
insist on "typewritten, double-spaced," there&#8217;s a special
macro&mdash;
<a href="docprocessing.html#printstyle"><kbd>PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE</kbd></a>&mdash;
that changes typeset documents into ones that would make an
old-school typing teacher proud.  Footnotes, endnotes, tables of
contents, multiple columns, nested lists, recto/verso printing and
user designable headers and footers are also part of the fun.
</p>

<h2 id="intro-philosophy" class="docs">Mom&#8217;s philosophy</h2>

<p>
Formatting documents should be easy, from soup to nuts.  Writers
need to focus on what they&#8217;re writing, not on how it looks.
From the moment you fire up an editor to the moment you add
"FINIS" to your opus, nothing should interfere with the flow of
your words.  The commands needed to format your work should be
easy to remember, comprehensible, and stand out well from the
text.  There shouldn&#8217;t be too much clutter.  Your documents
should be as readable inside a text editor as they are on the
printed page.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, in computerland, &#8220;easy,&#8221;
&#8220;comprehensible,&#8221; and &#8220;readable&#8221; often
mean &#8220;you&#8217;re stuck with what you get.&#8221; No
document formatting system can give you exactly what you want all
the time, every time.  Documents always need to be tweaked, either
to satisfy a typographic whim or to clarify some aspect of their
content.
</p>

<p>
Groff has traditionally solved the problem of formatting vs.
tweaking by requiring users of the common macro packages (mm, ms,
me and their offspring) to resort to groff
<a href="definitions.html#primitives">primitives</a>
and
<a href="definitions.html#inlines">inline escapes</a>
for their special typesetting needs.  Not to put too fine a point
on it, groff primitives tend toward the abstruse, and most inline
escapes are about as readable as an encrypted password.  This does
not make for happy-camper writers, who either find themselves stuck
with a formatting style they don&#8217;t like, or are forced to
learn groff from the ground up&mdash;a daunting task, to say the
least.
</p>

<p>
Mom aims to make creating documents a simple matter, but with no
corresponding loss of user control.  The document processing macros
provide an initial set of reasonable defaults, but anything that
is not to your liking can be changed.  In combination with the
typesetting macros, you have all the tools you need to massage
passages and tweak pages until they look utterly professional.
</p>

<p>
One rarely hears the term &#8220;user interface&#8221; in
conjunction with document processing.  Since formatting takes
place inside a text editor, little thought is given to the
look and feel of the formatting commands.  Mom attempts to
rectify this by providing users with a consistent, readable
&#8220;coding&#8221; style.  Most of the macros (especially in
the document processing set) have humanly-readable names.  Not
only does this speed up learning the macros, it makes the sense
of what&#8217;s going on in a document easier to decipher,
typographically and structurally.
</p>

<p>
Mom does not try to be all things to all people.  In contrast to
the normal groff philosophy, she does not try to produce output
that looks good no matter where it&#8217;s displayed.  She&#8217;s
designed for primarily for PDF or PostScript output, although
with <a href="docprocessing.html#printstyle"><kbd>PRINTSTYLE
TYPEWRITE</kbd></a>
she produces acceptable terminal copy.  No attempt is made to be
compatible with older versions of troff.
</p>

<p>
One special feature in mom&#8217;s design is the attention she pays
to aligning the bottom margins of every page.  Nothing screams
shoddy in typeset documents louder than bottom margins that
wander, or, in typesetter jargon, &#8220;hang.&#8221; There are,
of course, situations where whitespace at the bottom of a page
may be unavoidable (for example, you wouldn&#8217;t want a head
to appear at the bottom of the page without some text underneath
it), but in all cases where hanging bottom margins can be avoided,
mom does avoid them, by clever adjustments to leading (&#8220;line
spacing&#8221;) and the spacing between different elements on the
page.
</p>

<h2 id="intro-documentation" class="docs">A note on mom&#8217;s documentation</h2>

<p>
Writing documentation is tough, no doubt about it.  One is never
quite sure of the user&#8217;s level of expertise.  Is s/he new to
the application, new to its underlying protocols and programs, new
to the operating system?  At some point, one has to decide for whom
the documentation is intended.  Making the wrong choice can mean the
difference between a program that gets used and a program that gets
tossed.
</p>

<p>
Mom&#8217;s documentation assumes users know their way around
their own operating system (basic file management, how to use
the command line, how to use a text editor, etc).  I run GNU/Linux,
and while the documentation may exhibit a GNU/Linux bias, mom
and groff can, in fact, be run on other platforms.
</p>

<p>
The documentation further assumes users at least know what groff
is, even if they don&#8217;t know much about it.  Lastly,
it assumes that everyone&mdash;groff newbies and experts
alike&mdash;learns faster from a few well-placed examples than
from manpage-style reference docs.  What mom&#8217;s documentation
doesn&#8217;t assume is that you know everything&mdash;not about
groff, not about typesetting, not about document processing.  Even
experts have odd lacunae in their knowledge base.  Therefore,
whenever I suspect that a term or procedure will cause head
scratching, I offer an explanation.  And when explanations
aren&#8217;t enough, I offer examples.
</p>

<h3 id="canonical" class="docs">Canonical reference materials</h3>

<p>
The canonical reference materials for groff are
<strong>cstr54</strong> (a downloadable PostScript copy of which
is available
<a href="http://www.kohala.com/start/troff/cstr54.ps">here</a>)
and the <strong>troff</strong> and <strong>groff_diff</strong>
manpages.  The most complete and up-to-date source of information is
the groff info pages, available by typing <kbd>info groff</kbd> at
the command line (assuming you have the TeXinfo standalone browser
installed on your system, which is standard for most GNU/Linux
distributions).  And for inputting special characters, see <kbd>man
groff_char</kbd>.
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 24px;">
I&#8217;ve tried to avoid reiterating the information contained
in these documents; however, in a few places, this has proved
impossible.  But be forewarned: I have no qualms about
sidestepping excruciating completeness concerning groff usage;
I&#8217;m more interested in getting mom users up and running.
<i>Mea culpa.</i>
</p>

<p>
Groff has ancillary programmes (pre-processors) for generating
tables (<strong>tbl</strong>), diagrams (<strong>pic</strong>), and
equations (<strong>eqn</strong>), which may be used in conjuction
with mom.  The manuals describing their usage are found at:

<b>Note:</b> Mom&#8217;s macro file (om.tmac) is heavily
commented.  Each macro is preceded by a description of its
arguments, function and usage, which may give you information in

<strong>Addendum:</strong> The main macro file, om.tmac, is stripped
of comments when groff is built from sources. om.tmac in the sources
themselves still contains the comments, as do the tarballs posted on
mom&#8217;s homepage.

<h2 id="macro-args" class="docs">How to read macro arguments</h2>

<p>
The concise descriptions of macros in this documentation typically
look like this:
</p>

<div class="box-macro-args">
Macro: <b>MACRO_NAME</b> <kbd class="macro-args">arguments</kbd>
</div>

<p>
<kbd>arguments</kbd> lists the macro&#8217;s
arguments using conventions that should be familiar to anyone who
has ever read a manpage.  Briefly:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Macro arguments are separated from each other by spaces.</li>
  <li>If an argument is surrounded by chevrons
      (<kbd>&lt;&nbsp;&gt;</kbd>), it&#8217;s a description
      of the argument, not the argument itself.
  </li>
  <li>If an argument begins with or is surrounded by double-quotes, the
      double quotes must be included in the argument.
  </li>
  <li>If the user has a choice between several arguments, each of the
      choices is separated by the pipe character
      (<kbd>|</kbd>), which means &#8220;or.&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>Arguments that are optional are surrounded by square brackets.</li>
  <li><kbd>&lt;off&gt;</kbd> or <kbd>&lt;anything&gt;</kbd> in an argument
      list means that any argument other than those in the argument
      list turns the macro off.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toggle-macro" class="docs">Toggle macros</h3>

<p>
Some macros don&#8217;t require an argument.  They simply start
something.  When you need to turn them off, the same macro with
any argument will do the trick.  That&#8217;s right: <em>any</em>
argument (in caps, lowercase or a mixture thereof).  This permits
choosing whatever works for you: <kbd>OFF, end, Quit, Q, X</kbd>,
and so on.
</p>

<p>
Since these macros toggle things on and off, the argument list
simply reads <kbd>toggle</kbd>.
</p>

<div id="examples" class="examples-container">
<h2 class="docs" style="margin-top: .5em;">Examples</h2>

<div class="examples">Example 1: An argument requiring double-quotes</div>

<div class="box-macro-args" style="max-width: 684px;">
Macro: <b>TITLE</b> <kbd class="macro-args">&quot;&lt;title of document&gt;&quot;</kbd>
</div>

<p>
The required argument to TITLE is the title of your document.
Since it&#8217;s surrounded by double-quotes, you must include
them in the argument, like this:
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  .TITLE "My Pulitzer Novel"
</span>
</p>

<div class="examples" style="margin-top: -1em;">Example 2: A macro with required and optional arguments</div>

<div class="box-macro-args"  style="width: 684px;">
Macro: <b>TAB_SET</b> <kbd class="macro-args">&lt;tab number&gt;  &lt;indent&gt;  &lt;length&gt;  [ L | R | C | J [ QUAD ] ]&nbsp;</kbd>
</div>

<p>
The first required argument is a number that identifies the tab
(say, "3").  The second required argument is an indent from the
left margin (say, 6 picas).  The third required argument is the
length of the tab (say, 3 picas).  Therefore, at a minimum, when
using this macro, you would enter:
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  .TAB_SET 3 6P 3P
</span>
The remaining two arguments are optional.  The first is a
single letter, either <kbd>L, R, C</kbd> or
<kbd>J</kbd>.  The second, which is itself
optional after <kbd>L, R, C</kbd> or
<kbd>J</kbd>, is the word <kbd>QUAD</kbd>.
Therefore, depending on what additional information you wish to
pass to the macro, you could enter:
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  .TAB_SET 3 6P 3P L
</span>
or
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  .TAB_SET 3 6P 3P L QUAD
</span>
</p>

<div id="toggle-example" class="examples" style="margin-top: -1em;">Example 3: A sample toggle macro:</div>

<div class="box-macro-args" style="max-width: 684px;">
Macro: <b>QUOTE</b> <kbd class="macro-args">toggle</kbd>
</div>

<p>
<kbd>QUOTE</kbd> begins a section of quoted text
in a document and doesn&#8217;t require an argument.  When the
quote&#8217;s finished, you have to tell mom it&#8217;s done.
<span class="pre">
  .QUOTE
  So runs my dream, but what am I?
  An infant crying in the night
  An infant crying for the light
  And with no language but a cry.
  .QUOTE OFF
</span>
</p>

<p>
  Alternatively, you could have turned the quote off with
  <kbd>END</kbd>, or <kbd>X</kbd>, or something else.
